Europe’s Latest Vaccine Controversy Risks Being a Crisis Too Far," The European Union prides itself on its habit of emerging stronger from crises. Its chaotic vaccine rollout may prove the exception to the rule. The move by several countries to suspend   Plc’s Covid vaccine over concerns about its safety — against the advice of the bloc’s regulator — is exposing flaws in the communal system that threaten to weaken the EU politically and economically. According to several European officials, the decisions taken in capitals from Copenhagen to Rome were made without any coordination with each other or the EU executive in Brussels. Italy and France indicated later on Tuesday that they’re ready to lift the suspensions. But the result is that what appears to be a unilateral free-for-all risks further harming the bloc’s return to economic health and reputation as a whole. “It looks like quite an uncoordinated, spontaneous decision, perhaps out of political nervousness,”  Guntram Wolff , director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels, told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday, referring to the original suspensions. He said such moves were “devastating” for a rapid vaccine rollout.  The 27-nation bloc was slow out the gates to begin vaccinating its 450 million inhabitants, especially in comparison to the post-Brexit U.K. The relative speed at which the U.K. has inoculated its population, offering the prospect of reopening shops and businesses and even travel abroad, has been a key driving force behind the pound’s rally this year. Sterling rose to a one-year high against the euro in February, threatening the further indignity for Europe of soon witnessing Britons able to holiday on the continent and getting a bargain while doing so. The sense of rudderlessness and panic in the EU was compounded this week when countries including its biggest economies suspended use of the AstraZeneca shot to examine potential side effects as reports emerged of serious blood clotting after inoculation. The European Medicines Agency, the bloc-wide regulator, insisted it was safe and said the move risked undermining trust in vaccines. It is due to give definitive guidance on Thursday. A slow take-up in vaccinations will come at a high price by keeping businesses under virus curbs for longer, according to  Maeva Cousin , an economist at Bloomberg Economics, who estimates the economic loss for each week that restrictions linger at about 3% of gross domestic product. That’s at a time when Europe risks being left behind by President Joe Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion U.S. stimulus, which he aims to follow with a separate infrastructure program. With Covid deaths on the rise again and governments prolonging or re-tightening lockdowns, the political ramifications of the mess that Europe finds itself in are profound. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , who has said she’ll step down this year after 16 years at the helm of Europe’s dominant power, saw her Christian Democratic Union suffer historic defeats in state elections on Sunday that were a test of voter opinion before September’s federal ballot.   in a weekly national poll released Wednesday plunged against the backdrop of the slow rollout, and Merkel is facing opposition calls to sack her health minister following the AstraZeneca suspension. Mario Draghi ’s honeymoon period as Italian prime minister came to an abrupt halt after barely a month, as infections hit three-month highs and he shut down schools again. Perhaps most damaging of all for Europe’s political outlook, French President  Emmanuel Macron , who faces an election in the spring of 2022, has watched his lead over far-right challenger Marine le Pen grow ever narrower as she lands blows over his handling of the pandemic. “The EU’s vaccine rollout, or the lack thereof, will have long lasting effects on European politics, could see incumbent governments lose power, and could hinder economic recovery particularly in worst-hit countries,” said Camino Mortera, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform in Brussels. In the EU’s decision-making bodies, as in capitals from Berlin to Lisbon, officials are asking how Europe got into such dire straits. In the eyes of EU officials, flamboyant populists such as  Donald Trump  and  Boris Johnson  failed to afford the pandemic the gravity it required, unlike Europe with its more staid, safety-first attitude. But where the bloc’s more cautious approach helped keep its mortality rate down last year, it may have hindered its cause once vaccines became available. Whereas the U.K. government gambled early on vaccine investment and rushed through emergency approval to get people inoculated fast, the EU’s more rigid adherence to scientific process rendered it sluggish. That lack of flexibility was one reason cited by Brexiters for leaving the bloc, and it may have played a role in the AstraZeneca impasse. The EU has now administered 11 doses per 100 people, compared to 33 doses in the U.S. and 39 doses in the U.K., according to the  . Still, the EU has legitimate concerns over a shortfall in vaccine deliveries. That is especially true of U.K.-produced AstraZeneca — regardless of European reluctance to use it — with only about a third of the original doses due to be delivered in the first half. In a sign of potential tension with the U.S., the Biden administration rebuffed European pleas to share its shots, saying Americans must be vaccinated first. The EU is often accused of having slow processes but this episode shows how fundamental safety is for the bloc, according to a French official. The official stressed that the suspensions had been coordinated, and said that Macron exchanged texts with Merkel on the matter and spoke by phone with Draghi on Tuesday morning. Governments insisted that the decision to suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine isn’t a politically motivated effort to punish the company for its delivery failings or because it’s seen as a post-Brexit U.K. success story. The move was “a precautionary one,” Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza told an online health conference. But that’s not a view shared everywhere. One European government official said the foundations for the present situation were laid early in the vaccination rollout when Germany said efficacy concerns meant it wouldn’t use AstraZeneca to inoculate the elderly. That put pressure on other countries to follow suit. Several EU officials said Germany’s decision to suspend the shot had a similar knock-on effect around the bloc. In a   to mark Europe Day on May 9 last year, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen invoked the spirit of Robert Schuman, one of the EU’s founding fathers, who showed that “getting out of moments of crisis required new political thinking and breaking from the past.” During the pandemic, she said, “we must do the same.” “We must recognize that the Europe that will come out of this crisis cannot and will not be the same as the one that entered it,” she said.  Whether it is stronger or weaker now hangs in the balance.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/europe-s-latest-vaccine-controversy-risks-being-a-crisis-too-far,"[{'id': 'berlin', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.4045668233713902, 'directScore': 0.4045668233713902}, {'id': 'rome', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.9351242444593687, 'directScore': 0.9351242444593687}, {'id': 'EUR:CUR', 'type': 'Currency', 'derivedScore': 0.781464069845534, 'directScore': 0.781464069845534}, {'id': 'GBP:CUR', 'type': 'Currency', 'derivedScore': 1.578374748153123, 'directScore': 1.578374748153123}, {'id': '3977809', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.21773002014775017, 'directScore': 0.21773002014775017}, {'id': '2432301', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.3844190732034923, 'directScore': 0.3844190732034923}, {'id': '1252249', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.38670248488918735, 'directScore': 0.38670248488918735}, {'id': '16219480', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.6783075889858965, 'directScore': 0.6783075889858965}, {'id': '13387985', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.8886501007387508, 'directScore': 0.8886501007387508}, {'id': '1516502', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 1.3494963062458025, 'directScore': 1.3494963062458025}, {'id': 'AONE:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.12249832102081934, 'directScore': 0.12249832102081934}, {'id': '7535532Z:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 1.788448623237072, 'directScore': 1.788448623237072}, {'id': 'AZN:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 5.880467573012906, 'directScore': 5.880467573012906}, {'id': 'politics', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.6350693602615278, 'directScore': 0.4556077904633983}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.131105504108482, 'directScore': 0.4656816655473472}, {'id': 'elections', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5856279382135662, 'directScore': 0.5856279382135662}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6377434519811954, 'directScore': 0.6377434519811954}, {'id': 'gdp', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.661517797179315, 'directScore': 0.661517797179315}, {'id': 'economics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.674278038952317, 'directScore': 0.674278038952317}, {'id': 'travel', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7981195433176629, 'directScore': 0.7981195433176629}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.8447280053727333, 'directScore': 1.8447280053727333}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 12.547279424713148, 'directScore': 11.45762256548019}, {'id': 'DE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.7293485560779047, 'directScore': 0.7293485560779047}, {'id': 'IT', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.9231699126930826, 'directScore': 0.9231699126930826}, {'id': 'FR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.3402283411685696, 'directScore': 1.3402283411685696}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.12249832102081934, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6443250503693754, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'monetary-policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6443250503693754, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 6.169817133362823, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'currency', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.771828835395116, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.12249832102081934, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'UK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 6.362380765858361, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 3.8729974343093287, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'GB', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 6.362380765858361, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'industrials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.880467573012906, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.12249832102081934, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'science', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6443250503693754, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'materials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.788448623237072, 'directScore': 0}]"
Trump’s Ailing Empire: His Fortune Slips to $2.3 Billion as Covid and Riot Take a Toll," For the full experience visit:  Donald Trump upended the American presidency after stepping away from the company that made him rich and famous. Four years later, returning to his empire after losing the White House, what he finds may upend him. Trump’s net worth is down to $2.3 billion from $3 billion when he became president, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The pandemic he promised would disappear is walloping his company, and the riot that got him impeached for a second time is wounding his brand. His financial disclosures and loan documents, interviews with former executives and industry analysts, and a host of legal fights and investigations reveal just how much trouble Trump and his company could face. Covid has been hard on office buildings key to his wealth and hotels and resorts that bear his name. The fallout from the Capitol assault has hurt his relationships with brokers and lenders. At least $590 million in loans come due in the next four years, more than half personally guaranteed by Trump, and his scrapyard of failed enterprises has only gotten more crowded. But Trump, whose company declined to comment, has bounced back before. A post-pandemic economic recovery could reinflate the value of his properties. He could continue his run of bestsellers, pivot back to television or start a rival to the social media platforms that have shunned him. Even if things go poorly, he could make the best of losses by using them to slash his tax bills, as he’s done for years.  Only Trump knows what he’s thinking as he contemplates the defeat he denies and teases another run. When he looks around, much of what he sees will be sad and some will be a total disaster. Inside his empire is a grab bag of opportunities that no former politician can rival and threats that no tycoon would want.",https://bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-donald-trump-net-worth-business/,"[{'id': 'white-house', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 0.8490466101694916, 'directScore': 0.8490466101694916}, {'id': 'social-media', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.2526483050847458, 'directScore': 0.2526483050847458}, {'id': 'wealth', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5466101694915254, 'directScore': 0.5466101694915254}, {'id': 'executives', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6488347457627118, 'directScore': 0.6488347457627118}, {'id': 'billionaires', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.770656779661017, 'directScore': 0.770656779661017}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 3.8729974343093287, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'politics', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.8490466101694916, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'culture', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.8729974343093287, 'directScore': 0}]"
"Yields Jump, Tech Declines Amid Dot Plot Anxiety: Markets Wrap"," Treasury yields climbed to more than one-year highs and growth stocks favored under the so-called reflation trade fell amid concern Federal Reserve officials could revise forecasts for when they see a liftoff from near-zero rates. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 slumped for the first time in three trading sessions as U.S. central bankers meet for a second day. The S&P 500 also declined, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher amid a rotation back to value stocks such as Boeing Co. Fuel-cell firm Plug Power Inc. tumbled after it   accounting errors. “The interest rate game continues to be the key catalyst among movement within the U.S. equity market. The 10-year Treasury yield rises, the Nasdaq 100 falls and partially drags the S&P 500 with it,”said  Michael O’Rourke , chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “The Federal Reserve certainly does not need to react to every signal the market provides. The market just wants the chairman to indicate that he is not blind to it.” Expectations of a strong recovery from the Covid-19 slump are putting an intense focus on Fed officials’ projections for interest rates displayed in their “dot plot.” Two-thirds of economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect policy makers to continue to signal no liftoff from near-zero rates through 2023, though more of the 18 central bankers could drift their dots higher. The yield on 30-year Treasuries spiked to a level unseen since 2019 and the 10-year hit 1.67%. Market-implied  inflation  expectations are at 12-year highs. The dollar strengthened versus most major peers. “So what happens with the fixed income markets will ultimately determine also what happens with equity markets too, especially if those fixed income yields start to rise,” said  Rohan Reddy , a research analyst at Global   Management. “So I would expect them to come out with a slightly more detailed policy, and if they don’t you could see a bit of a market selloff.” Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell, and South Korean stocks retreated as   warned it’s grappling with the fallout from a “serious imbalance” in semiconductors globally.

U.K. Regulator Considers Diversity Quotas for Firms Going Public," Companies looking to join the London stock market could face new requirements around the diversity of their boardrooms, according to the U.K.’s top financial regulator. Nikhil Rathi , chief executive officer of the  Financial Conduct Authority , said in a speech Wednesday that the watchdog would “look hard at the way capital markets work” as it reviews how to boost the number of women and people of color at the top levels of the industry. “In the U.S., we have seen the Nasdaq take the lead with its listing rules, which will require all companies listed on its U.S. exchange to have, or explain why they do not have, at least two diverse directors,” Rathi said in a speech Wednesday. “We will be exploring whether we should make similar requirements part of our premium listing rules.” Rathi was speaking as part of the U.K. Treasury’s   of women in finance, which found that the disruption of Covid-19 slowed many firms’ progress on hiring more senior women. Of the 81 firms that pledged to reach their own targets last year, only 37 did so. Rathi, who warned last year that the   on firms with poor records on diversity, said the issue could also be added to the FCA’s approval process for senior managers. “We care because diversity reduces conduct risk and those firms that fail to reflect society run the risk of poorly serving diverse communities. And, at that point, diversity and inclusion become regulatory issues,” he said.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/u-k-could-set-diversity-thresholds-for-ipos-regulator-says,"[{'id': '2630281Z:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.8592394929953302, 'directScore': 0.8592394929953302}, {'id': 'london', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 3.441064502083225, 'directScore': 3.441064502083225}, {'id': 'inclusion', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.485934044339693, 'directScore': 0.028685790527018012}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.3695797198132088, 'directScore': 0.3695797198132088}, {'id': 'capital-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7925283522348232, 'directScore': 0.7925283522348232}, {'id': 'women', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.4856571047364908, 'directScore': 1.4856571047364908}, {'id': '19064053', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 2.1567711807871914, 'directScore': 2.1567711807871914}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.8592394929953302, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 4.887129329927085, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'equality', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.674794974988966, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'GB', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 3.548341262788511, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.887129329927085, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 3.548341262788511, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.3695797198132088, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg-concerns', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.4856571047364908, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'well-spent', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.887129329927085, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'megacity', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.441064502083225, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8592394929953302, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'gender-equality', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.4856571047364908, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'personal-finance', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.887129329927085, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'UK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 3.548341262788511, 'directScore': 0}]"
"Biden Agrees Putin Is Killer, Says He’ll Pay Price for Meddling"," President  Joe Biden  agreed that Russian President  Vladimir Putin  is a “killer,” and said in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday that Russia would pay for alleged interference in U.S. elections. His comments, recorded Tuesday, came the same day as a U.S. intelligence community report that Putin ordered influence operations to hurt Biden’s candidacy, favoring former President  Donald Trump  just as the intelligence community says the Russian leader did in 2016 against then-Democratic presidential candidate  Hillary Clinton . Putin “will pay a price” for the interference, Biden said. In a “long talk” with the Russian leader, Biden said he told him, “I know you and you know me. If I establish this occurred, then be prepared.” After ABC News Chief Anchor  George Stephanopoulos  asked Biden if he believes Putin is “a killer,” Biden murmured agreement and said “I do,” without elaborating. Russia’s ruble sank as much as 1.6% to 74 per dollar, its biggest intraday loss since Feb. 25. The benchmark MOEX index also extended declines, and was down 2.1% as of 2:37 p.m. in Moscow. Ten-year bond yields were up three basis points at 6.84%, near their highest in a year. Vyacheslav Volodin , the speaker of the lower house of Russia’s parliament and a longtime Putin ally, dismissed Biden’s comments as “hysterics born of helplessness,” saying they “insult the citizens of our country.” Many officials in Putin’s government and associates of the Russian leader already live under U.S. sanctions due to previous rounds of punishment for election interference, attacks on political opponents and Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, leaving unclear what Biden may target. CNN reported that the U.S. may sanction more Putin associates. Biden said that in a past conversation with Putin, he told him that he “looked in your eyes and I don’t think you have a soul.” The remark was a reference to George W. Bush’s 2001 assessment of Putin, when the former U.S. president said that “I looked the man in the eye” and “was able to get a sense of his soul.” In December, then-Director of National Intelligence and Trump ally  John Ratcliffe  held up completion of Tuesday’s report, saying it needed to more fully reflect the national security threat posed by China, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of the information. But in the end the report indicated that China did not “deploy interference efforts” in an effort to change the election outcome. Earlier Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  denounced the U.S. intelligence report as “absolutely groundless.” “It’s regrettable that the beginning of each presidential term in the U.S. seems to be linked to imposing sanctions on Russia,” he said. Putin has vociferously denied allegations his government is behind attacks on opponents. While the Kremlin has said it hopes for improved relations under the Biden administration, officials have few illusions that ties will get much better.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/biden-agrees-putin-is-killer-says-he-ll-pay-price-for-meddling,"[{'id': 'moscow', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.6200569440050617, 'directScore': 0.6200569440050617}, {'id': 'USD:CUR', 'type': 'Currency', 'derivedScore': 0.6618158810503005, 'directScore': 0.6618158810503005}, {'id': '17163546', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.5906358747231889, 'directScore': 0.5906358747231889}, {'id': '1442508', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.8402404302435938, 'directScore': 0.8402404302435938}, {'id': '1252249', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 1.1622904144258146, 'directScore': 1.1622904144258146}, {'id': '1920085', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 12.867431834419467, 'directScore': 12.867431834419467}, {'id': '13387985', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 14.464152346412627, 'directScore': 14.464152346412627}, {'id': 'national-security', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5352736475798798, 'directScore': 0.5352736475798798}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8668146453944651, 'directScore': 0.5776652957924708}, {'id': 'economic-sanctions', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5782980069598229, 'directScore': 0.5782980069598229}, {'id': 'bonds', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6146788990825688, 'directScore': 0.6146788990825688}, {'id': 'elections', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.7810232309363148, 'directScore': 1.7810232309363148}, {'id': 'CN', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.41695665928503634, 'directScore': 0.41695665928503634}, {'id': 'UA', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.44859221765264157, 'directScore': 0.44859221765264157}, {'id': 'RU', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 4.375794558031681, 'directScore': 4.375794558031681}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.9472654749598204, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.6146788990825688, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'u-s-presidential-election-2020', 'type': 'Event', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'politics', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.3061566034190857, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 4.398788665166939, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'economics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5782980069598229, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.418596776487812, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.41695665928503634, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.6618158810503005, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'brics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.395659848028333, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6146788990825688, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'megacity', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6200569440050617, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'currency', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6618158810503005, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.6618158810503005, 'directScore': 0}]"
Americans Have $1.7 Trillion to Burn in Revenge-Spending Binge," Shoppers are out for vengeance. A year into a pandemic that’s devastated lives, jobs and the economy, those who are lucky enough to have disposable income are ready to go out and splurge — even if they still have nowhere to go in that stunning dress or those brand new sneakers. Some are calling this “revenge spending.” U.S.  retail sales  are near record highs and employment and vaccinations are on the rise. Americans have amassed a massive stockpile of excess savings — Bloomberg Economics estimates it to be about $1.7 trillion since the beginning of the pandemic through January. And that’s about to be bolstered by a new round of stimulus payments. As the economy reopens, consumer spending over the next two quarters is likely to be the strongest such period in at least 70 years with a rebound in services leading the way, according to economists at Wells Fargo & Co. “A lot of the snapback in spending will come from those more leisure expenditures — your discretionary expenditures,” said  Shannon Seery , an economist at Wells Fargo. Those are the areas that “we really expect to bounce back once the economy returns to some semblance of normal."" Revenge spending was seen as early as last April in China after the government began easing back to normalcy after the nation was the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in its early days. The impact on companies was clear: U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co.’s China sales surged 90% in May from the year prior, while Hermes, the French luxury label known for its $10,000 handbags, raked in $2.7 million in one day from a store reopening in Guangzhou. China has been recovering ever since, even as the virus continues to rage across Europe and North America. The reopening of the nation’s domestic travel corridors sparked a tourism revival, with locals visiting destinations like Macau and Hainan. They’ve been spending so much there that brands like Ralph Lauren Corp., Estee Lauder Cos. and Coach are all scrambling to  . There’s universal hope that there’ll be a similar fervor in the U.S. too. While the U.S. economy will likely reopen gradually over the course of 2021, the federal government is already starting to distribute stimulus checks.  suggests one-time payments boost spending more than steady payments that lead to a higher income. “This round of stimulus is coming at the same time that the economy is properly reopening,"" said  Michelle Meyer , head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Corp. “If you have a lot in your bank account already, you don't have very much debt to pay off, you probably do feel more comfortable spending the stimulus check.” Even the previous round of $600 stimulus checks, which were less than half the size of the incoming $1,400 payments, helped drive a January spike in discretionary purchases. U.S. retail sales jumped by the most in seven months amid increased spending on clothes, electronics, home furnishings and more. Department stores saw a nearly 21% increase in sales from the prior month.  And there’s room to grow, since sales at many types of stores and restaurants remain below their pre-pandemic levels. While   from January’s breakneck pace — in large part due to severe winter weather — the new round of direct checks will give fresh support to consumers. The $1,400 payments could give restaurant sales a lift for up to seven weeks, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence.  It may take slightly longer for the wealthiest to shell out cash like they once did. The top 10% of earners account for nearly half of personal outlays in the U.S., according to calculations by Wells Fargo. These consumers, who have been forced into saving because of social distancing, are likely to come out in full force as the health crisis subsides and herd immunity is reached, Meyer said. Almost half of U.S. consumers, meanwhile, said they’d buy little luxuries in the next six months. Over a third said they’d go in on even bigger, more expensive products, according to a survey from Accenture.  U.S. retailers from discount clothing stores to luxury jewelry boutiques have been waiting for this for months. Signet Jewelers Ltd., owner of Jared and Kay Jewelers, had hoped it’d come in time to bolster Valentine’s Day sales in February. That didn’t work out, but it’s better late than never.  The CEOs of Abercrombie & Fitch Co., Coty Inc. and TJX Cos., which operates TJ Maxx, have each mentioned the prospect of revenge shopping boosting business in the coming months. Poshmark Inc., an online resale marketplace, said sales of summer dresses doubled in February from a year earlier. CEO Manish Chandra said it’s an early sign that the population is ready to get out and spend.  “That to me tells us that we are getting ready for something,” said Chandra. “I think we’re all ready for that. America’s definitely ready and the world seems to be ready as well.” Rileigh Christenson, a 23-year-old in Elk Rapids, Michigan, who works in marketing, said she’s extremely ready. She’s committed to taking a dream vacation with her boyfriend after waiting to do something — anything — for the past year. They started putting aside money until they had a few thousand dollars to blow once the virus recedes. “I randomly saw someone on TikTok who was in Alaska and I was like, ‘You know what? I’m pulling the trigger,’” Christenson said. “It’s happening as soon as it’s safe.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/retailers-prepare-for-wave-of-shoppers-as-covid-vaccines-rollout,"[{'id': 'san-francisco', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore':

Apple Dodges French Antitrust Order on Ad Rules Amid Probe,"  dodged a French freeze on planned changes to the way it collects iPhone users’ data -- but faces an in-depth probe into whether the measures will harm advertisers. While Apple’s app tracking transparency in the forthcoming iOS 14 software update doesn’t seem to be unfair or abusive, the French Competition Authority will examine whether the company applied less stringent rules to itself than to other services, the regulator said on Wednesday. The authority rejected advertisers’ call for so-called interim measures that could have prevented Apple from rolling out the update this year. “We need to get into the machine, into the matrix, because that’s where Apple’s -- as well as Google’s and  ’s -- economic structuring happens,” French antitrust chief Isabelle de Silva told reporters at a Paris press conference, referring to a shift toward more oversight of U.S. tech giants. Online advertising has attracted intense   from   in recent months as both Apple and Google roll out initiatives to curb user tracking which they say will improve personal privacy. Advertisers complain that losing the ability to track how ads prompt purchases will   revenue and give more control to online platforms. De Silva said the case shows the need for fast antitrust action into technical issues, she said, promising a final ruling by early 2022 at the latest. An emergency antitrust order to halt Apple’s moves immediately wasn’t warranted since Apple had already delayed the changes until March or April to allow advertisers develop alternatives. “Apple is in a very special situation with its users,” she said. “Self-preferencing is about serving oneself better” than the smaller services that rely on the platform. Apple’s self-proclaimed privacy push includes   for users to tick a box to consent to data collection for its so-called identification for advertisers, or IDFA service on the iOS 14 software release due this year. App developers have historically used IDFA to help target users with ads and track the performance of ads across different devices. The French authority said that Apple’s rules themselves don’t appear unfair but that officials still want to examine how Apple applies them. De Silva said getting the users to tick a box to grant consent wasn’t immediately deemed to be unfair. Apple is “grateful” to the authority “for recognizing that app tracking transparency in iOS 14 is in the best interest of French iOS users,” the company said in a statement. “We look forward to further engagement” with regulators on user privacy and competition. The French case comes as Apple also faces   probes from U.S.,  European Union , U.K. and Dutch regulators into its app store and payment system. CNIL, the French privacy regulator, said Tuesday it is also examining allegations that Apple’s personalized advertising feature violates EU privacy rules. De Silva said a separate probe into  Google ’s potential breach of an antitrust order on talks with publishers would get a decision soon, along with two other online advertising investigations involving companies she didn’t identify.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-faces-french-antitrust-probe-into-ios-14-ad-changes,"[{'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.14784, 'directScore': 0.14784}, {'id': 'paris', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.74336, 'directScore': 0.74336}, {'id': 'advertising', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.82336, 'directScore': 0.82336}, {'id': 'software', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.30688, 'directScore': 1.30688}, {'id': 'privacy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.46336, 'directScore': 1.46336}, {'id': 'ios', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.74624, 'directScore': 1.74624}, {'id': 'iphone', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.6653351724137933, 'directScore': 2.6653351724137933}, {'id': 'AMZN:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.776, 'directScore': 0.776}, {'id': 'GOOGL:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 1.52576, 'directScore': 1.52576}, {'id': 'AAPL:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 15.36704, 'directScore': 15.36704}, {'id': 'utilities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 15.36704, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 15.36704, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'culture', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 15.453232576735662, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'mobile-phones', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 15.36704, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'megacity', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.74336, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.776, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 15.453232576735662, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'technology', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 15.453232576735662, 'directScore': 0}]"
Sanjeev Gupta in Talks for New Funding to Replace Greensill Loans," Metals group  GFG Alliance  has started negotiations with a pair of investors who may provide new loans to plug the funding gap left by the insolvency of its key lender  Greensill Capital . York Capital Management  and  White Oak Global Advisors  held preliminary discussions to replace some of the $5 billion GFG credit facilities provided by Greensill, according to people familiar with the matter. White Oak has previously provided funds to GFG businesses in Australia. Several other   investors are also considering offering new loans if they can get a guarantee over GFG assets, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. The talks are at an early stage and may not lead to a deal, they said. Representatives for York, White Oak and GFG declined to comment on the discussions. Replacing the credit lines is key for the survival of GFG, a grouping of dozens of businesses controlled by  Sanjeev Gupta  and his family, which relied on funding provided by Greensill that was secured against future sales. The collapse of the lender earlier this month triggered a cash crunch at GFG, which employs 35,000 people in 30 countries. The investors are considering providing new financing lines to GFG’s most profitable units, the people said. The facilities would be backed by assets which haven’t already been pledged to other lenders. The group may not be able to continue operating in its current form even with the new facilities, according to the people. GFG has been working with administrators at Greensill to iron out a   to stave off a collapse. The reprieve is crucial for GFG to buy time and work out a strategy to fix its finances with creditors.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/york-white-oak-are-said-to-discuss-new-funding-for-gupta-s-gfg,"[{'id': 'debt', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8023782559456398, 'directScore': 0.8023782559456398}, {'id': 'hedge-funds', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.4898074745186862, 'directScore': 1.4898074745186862}, {'id': 'AU', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.7440543601359003, 'directScore': 0.7440543601359003}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.8023782559456398, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.7058793081703343, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.7440543601359003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8023782559456398, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'bonds', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8023782559456398, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fintech', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.4898074745186862, 'directScore': 0}]"
French Data Watchdog CNIL Opens Probe Into Clubhouse App," France’s data-protection watchdog said it’s opened a probe into private social media app  Clubhouse  following a complaint. French regulator CNIL said on Wednesday it questioned Alpha Exploration Co. Inc., the U.S. company behind the invite-only app, about the measures taken for the app to comply with  EU  rules on March 12. CNIL said the probe aims to confirm whether the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation applies to Clubhouse, even though it has no establishment in Europe. If so, the watchdog could make use of its sanctioning powers, it said. The probe follows   voiced by one of Germany’s most outspoken data protection regulators last month. The Hamburg data regulator asked the makers of the Clubhouse app for information about how they protect the privacy of European users and their contacts. Clubhouse users post off-the-cuff, informal conversations. It has become a popular platform, with about 5 million users by the end of January.

Uber’s U.K. Defeat Won’t Be Blueprint for Global Labor Fight," For years,   has been locked in a fierce and expensive contest with global regulators over the protections it offers to drivers. The gig economy giant has argued that drivers are free agents, able to work when and where they like, and are therefore not directly employed by Uber -- or eligible for benefits like sick leave and overtime. In its home state of California, Uber Chief Executive Officer  Dara Khosrowshahi  advocated for a “third way” of classifying workers -- other than as contractors or as full-time staff. And he’s suggested that the company’s approach in the state could be a blueprint for resolving similar labor battles brewing worldwide. But on Tuesday, Uber said it would adopt a different model for its drivers in the U.K. After losing a watershed ruling in Britain’s Supreme Court, the company agreed to reclassify all of its 70,000 drivers in the country as “workers,” which are guaranteed specific benefits under U.K. law. The result is essentially a “fourth way” for Uber -- and another example of the growing pressure the company is facing from world governments to treat its workers better and comply with with local rules. “Some countries have strong labor laws and some have none at all. We are all starting at different points,” said Vanessa Bain, co-founder of worker advocacy group Gig Workers Collective. “The complexities of different legal systems continue to be a challenge for both the workers that are organizing and for the companies.” Uber shares were down about 4% in the first hour of trading in New York on Wednesday. In the U.K., drivers will now be entitled to the minimum wage, vacation pay and a pension. Drivers in the country had already been getting health benefits since 2018 and will continue to get sickness, injury and parental leave as workers. Maria Figueroa, director of labor and policy research at Cornell University’s Worker Institute, said that while the new benefits are a step in the right direction, many will argue they don’t go far enough because Uber will still function as an employer without the same responsibilities. Regardless of the limitations, Figueroa said, “advocates in some countries will go for it” because they see it as the first in a series of steps required to win more protections for the world’s fast-growing population of gig workers. “To engage in a fight for full benefits is a long and winding road,” Figueroa said. “A lot of advocates are re-evaluating whether they want to do that.” In California, Uber and other gig economy companies effectively overturned a law last year that required them to classify their workers as employees. The company wrote and bankrolled a ballot proposal in the November election that overrode the law, but granted workers a few perks including a wage floor, a health insurance stipend and some mileage reimbursement. The proposal, sponsored by the country’s largest gig companies, was the most expensive measure in state history. Under the new rules in both California and the U.K., drivers will only be paid for the time they engage in a ride, and wages won’t cover time spent waiting for a passenger -- hours that account for roughly one-third of drivers’ workdays on average, according to a study by the University of California, Berkeley. Figueroa said the benefits offered in the U.K. for workers are similar to those required by Canada’s “dependent worker” category. And while she said that advocates in many countries wouldn’t be satisfied with the company’s U.K. policy, some of them might lobby for similar protections in their own markets. “Even the unions and the workers who won the ruling will tell you this isn’t enough, but it’s what we got now,” she said. The drivers who first brought the U.K. case against Uber say the company hasn’t gone far enough. Uber said drivers will be entitled to minumum wage after its accepted a trip from a customer, but the Supreme Court said drivers are working whenever they’re logged into the app. “While Uber undoubtedly has made progress here, we cannot accept anything less than full complience with legal minimums,” drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam said in a statement. Farrar said on Twitter that they expect to be back in court against Uber. The rights of gig workers and their employment classification is likely to remain a major flash point in the months and years to come. That will be particularly true as drivers return to work after the pandemic and companies increasingly face different pressures in different regions. For example, in New York, a proposal to allow gig workers to form unions and collectively bargain could be introduced this spring. In Seattle, the focus is on extending a pandemic hazard pay increase for grocery store employees to people in other jobs. And the cities of San Francisco and Oakland, California last year passed laws giving gig workers   80 hours of paid sick leave during the pandemic. “There’s no one path to get to where we need to go,” Bain said. “There are differences even among cities. It’s a complicated system.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/uber-s-u-k-defeat-won-t-be-blueprint-for-global-labor-battles,"[{'id': 'supreme-court', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 1.9295228460630587, 'directScore': 1.9295228460630587}, {'id': 'TWTR:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.3481706288990052, 'directScore': 0.3481706288990052}, {'id': 'UBER:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 18.169560110765328, 'directScore': 18.169560110765328}, {'id': 'new-york', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.8020569887034227, 'directScore': 0.8020569887034227}, {'id': 'california', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 2.2962400944191534, 'directScore': 2.2962400944191534}, {'id': 'oakland', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.0409711684370258, 'directScore': 0.0409711684370258}, {'id': 'san-francisco', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.04400606980273141, 'directScore': 0.04400606980273141}, {'id': 'seattle', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.06693643567695161, 'directScore': 0.06693643567695161}, {'id': 'jobs', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.048052604957005564, 'directScore': 0.048052604957005564}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.05142471758556736, 'directScore': 0.05142471758556736}, {'id': 'employment', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.1310065756196257, 'directScore': 0.1310065756196257}, {'id': 'labor-laws', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8098128477491148, 'directScore': 0.8098128477491148}, {'id': 'policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9824650143314786, 'directScore': 0.9824650143314786}, {'id': 'travel', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.489124936772888, 'directScore': 1.489124936772888}, {'id': 'law', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.885688505309604, 'directScore': 1.9067610858202664}, {'id': 'minimum-wage', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.2643736300792447, 'directScore': 2.2643736300792447}, {'id': 'labor', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.518441240937447, 'directScore': 4.518441240937447}, {'id': '16842259', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.6189512729725173, 'directScore': 0.6189512729725173}, {'id': '2037795', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.9300286629573428, 'directScore': 0.9300286629573428}, {'id': 'CA', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.3392345304333165, 'directScore': 0.3392345304333165}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9824650143314786, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'industrials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 18.169560110765328, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg-concerns', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.2643736300792447, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 18.176061724593566, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 18.17289598643015, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'technology', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.3481706288990052, 'directScore': 0}]"
Muted St. Patrick’s Day Offers Bar Owners Some Hope," For the ravaged  , St. Patrick’s Day is offering a little hope.  Pubs are seeing reservations book up. Outdoor space is being used to bring back some normalcy, with Irish bands and bagpipers returning for a holiday that is the biggest revenue generator of the year for many establishments. The Chicago River is once again  .  But expectations are also muted with Covid-19 restrictions still in place. Total spending on the holiday is expected to be $5.1 billion, according to the National Retail Federation. That’s about $1 billion less than the projection it made for 2020 before the pandemic arrived. At McSorley’s Old Ale House, a nearly 170-year-old pub in Manhattan, owner Gregory de la Haba has actually been telling customers to avoid the bar. Still, at least a dozen regulars plan to show up, which would top last year—by one. “I don’t want a crowd outside the bar,” de la Haba says. “The last thing we want is for the city to hold us up as an example as a superspreader.” , St. Patrick’s Day became the first major consumer spending event to be upended by the pandemic, with celebrations canceled and many bars closed. Now, pubs have reopened, but parades are still on hold. Only 10% of Americans who plan to celebrate the day said they will go to a bar or restaurant, down from 27% in 2020, this year’s NRF survey said.  At Ryan’s Daughter in Manhattan’s Upper East Side, owner Jim Gerding’s table reservations have booked up quickly, albeit with restrictions limiting capacity to 35% and a closing time cut to 11 p.m. He expects to see only about 20% of the sales in previous years.  “I will not be looking for a win in the financial power and the profitability of the day,” Gerding says. “This business is a long way away from becoming profitable again.” Emerald Loop Bar & Grill in downtown Chicago plans to put out a sign encouraging customers to go elsewhere instead of wait in line, according to bar owner Kevin Vaughan. The bar also scrapped its drinking packages to avert over-consumption. Preventive measures aside, this St. Patrick’s Day could at least be the most lucrative day for bars so far this year, with almost 80% of states allowing indoor dining, according to Matthew Crompton, client solutions director at Nielsen CGA. That would follow booze sales at bars and restaurants during last year’s holiday plunging 87%.  At Hailey’s Harp and Pub in Metuchen, N.J. bands, dancers and bagpipes will return, according to owner Mo Atzbi. Boosted by newly added outdoor tables, the bar hopes to earn 75% of its normal sales on Wednesday, when temperatures could surpass 50F. Bar closures also hit alcohol makers hard, although gains in   have helped offset this. Jameson Irish Whiskey, a St. Patrick’s Day staple, expects sales during the holiday to be “comparable” to pre-pandemic levels, according to Andrew Eis, marketing engagement director at parent company Pernod Ricard. While Jameson sales through on-premise channels such as bars are recovering, Eis expects consumers to sit back a little longer. The brand will “double down on the importance of on-premise” for the next St. Patrick’s Day, Eis says. “A lot of people will wait for a much, much longer period of time until they’re comfortable to return,” he says.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/st-patrick-s-day-2021-bars-open-parades-canceled-expectations-low,"[{'id': 'new-york', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.4299226139294927, 'directScore': 0.4299226139294927}, {'id': 'manhattan', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 1.3637145313843506, 'directScore': 1.3637145313843506}, {'id': 'chicago', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 1.3204356549154486, 'directScore': 1.3204356549154486}, {'id': 'alcohol', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.17856119231871598, 'directScore': 0.17856119231871598}, {'id': 'consumer-spending', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.648323301805675, 'directScore': 0.648323301805675}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7331613642877616, 'directScore': 0.7331613642877616}, {'id': 'retail', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.101396466206969, 'directScore': 0.8558326167956435}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.589280596159358, 'directScore': 4.589280596159358}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 4.589280596159358, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'luxury', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'new-york-city', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 1.3637145313843506, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'megacity', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.3637145313843506, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.648323301805675, 'directScore': 0}]"
Top Belgian Soccer Team Has Star Power at Heart of IPO Pitch," Club Brugge is about to join a select group of listed European soccer teams, offering investors a chance to back its promise of unearthing the next stars of the game. The leaders of Belgium’s top division will go public via an initial public offering in Brussels on or around March 26, according to a   prospectus. Grizzly Sports NV, an investor group led by Chairman Bart Verhaeghe, will sell at least 30% of Club Brugge at 17.50 euros to 22.50 euros per share, giving it a market value of 229 million euros ($272 million) at the mid-point. Verhaeghe is betting that a model of nurturing young talent and selling it on to the free-spending teams of Europe’s biggest leagues, where players are often bought in for eye-watering sums, will play a major part in wooing investors. “We are making stars,” said Verhaeghe, who nearly became a professional player at 18 only to be steered toward law school by his father. “Other teams are consuming stars.” Club Brugge adopts a data-driven approach to spotting and developing young players. Its regular participation in elite European competitions, including the UEFA Champions League, also helps it attract youngsters and then gives them a shop window to display their skills to potential suitors. In 2019, Club Brugge sold the Brazilian attacker Wesley Moraes and Zimbabwean midfielder Marvelous Nakamba to the U.K.’s Aston Villa F.C. in deals worth about 36 million euros combined, according to figures from the club. This year, Senegalese winger Krepin Diatta moved from Club Brugge to France’s AS Monaco for almost 17 million euros. The club’s latest hot prospect is Belgian youngster Charles De Ketelaere. “We have a unique way of making players the best version of themselves and we are dominant in the local market,” Verhaeghe said. “We educate this talent and if they do well they can move on to one of the top five leagues in Europe.” The Belgian club will join a small number of European soccer teams, including AFC Ajax, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus F.C. and Manchester United F.C., in having shares listed in the public markets. The sector has lagged broader European stocks over the last three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A  Deutsche Boerse AG  index of European soccer teams was closed down last summer because of lack of interest. “This is a club coming to the stock market where we are looking to make a profit,” Verhaeghe said. “I’d like to be listing as a company in a growing market but unfortunately some of my peers don’t run things in the same way.” Club Brugge saw   rise 148% to 24 million euros on operating income of 120 million euros in the year through June 2020, according to its IPO prospectus. To be sure, the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 crisis on soccer’s finances has dampened the market for buying and selling players, with even big-spenders like Manchester City F.C. and Real Madrid exercising caution in recent transfer windows. Club Brugge said its financial performance has been “resilient” amid the pandemic. Half of the club’s roughly 24,300 season ticket holders have not asked for refunds despite months of not being able to attend matches, Verhaeghe said. The club has plans to move into a new 40,000-seat stadium. “It will be like going from a Lada to Mercedes,” Verhaeghe said. Grizzly Sports will remain Club Brugge’s largest shareholder after the IPO and Verhaeghe will keep his role as chairman, according to the prospectus.  ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. ,  Berenberg  and Belfius Bank are working on the listing.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/club-brugge-puts-soccer-star-power-at-heart-of-ipo-pitch,"[{'id': 'madrid', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.17632719393282772, 'directScore': 0.17632719393282772}, {'id': '17409472', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 4.407908992416035, 'directScore': 4.407908992416035}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 6.448073762282693, 'directScore': 6.313143898355166}, {'id': 'JPM:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.020314192849404118, 'directScore': 0.020314192849404118}, {'id': 'CSGN:SW', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.026543878656554713, 'directScore': 0.026543878656554713}, {'id': 'DAI:GR', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.07340195016251354, 'directScore': 0.07340195016251354}, {'id': 'DB1:GR', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.4022210184182015, 'directScore': 0.4022210184182015}, {'id': 'MANU:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.6367822318526544, 'directScore': 0.6367822318526544}, {'id': 'MC', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.86863488624052, 'directScore': 0.86863488624052}, {'id': 'FR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.8751354279523293, 'directScore': 0.8751354279523293}, {'id': 'BE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.9512459371614301, 'directScore': 0.9512459371614301}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.18147345612134344, 'directScore': 0.18147345612134344}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.21695557963163598, 'directScore': 0.21695557963163598}, {'id': 'stocks', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.4228060671722644, 'directScore': 0.4228060671722644}, {'id': 'law', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7524377031419285, 'directScore': 0.7524377031419285}, {'id': 'sports', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9758938244853738, 'directScore': 0.9758938244853738}, {'id': 'ipos', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.092768147345613, 'directScore': 4.092768147345613}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.6903693185352997, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.4353936411786177, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.21695557963163598, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'culture', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.6371062566216261, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'CH', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.026543878656554713, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6410127568407533, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.6371062566216261, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'DE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.4089186374397642, 'directScore': 0}]"
How ‘Vaccine Day’ Could Boost Inoculations," In the last week, the U.S. Covid-19 vaccination rate accelerated to 2.43 million doses per day, according to  . More than  , and over 30 million people have fully vaccinated. The Biden administration is   and expand eligibility to all adults by no later than May 1. ‘’ As the supply of shots grows,   has emerged as a serious impediment to conquering the pandemic. Polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicates that   intend to get a Covid-19 vaccine, but recent surveys show a stark  , with about 50% of Republican men indicating they have no plans to receive any of the three federally approved vaccines. “If we don’t have 80-plus percent of the population vaccinated before next winter, this virus is going to come back raging,"" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee,  To move the needle on adoption, some public-health advocates are promoting an unorthodox incentive: a one-time-only federal holiday.  , which might fall on the Friday of Labor Day weekend 2021, would serve multiple purposes. Filled with live music, block parties and other in-person events, it would be a mass celebration that commemorates the doctors, nurses and other essential personnel who continue to work through the pandemic. And for groups that may still be reluctant to get their shot, the prospect of joining the festivities might help convince skeptics and holdouts to embrace inoculation beforehand. Vaccine Day might also be a time to actually get vaccinated — and a day off from work to do it. But the event’s primary role is symbolic, not practical. “The main goal is to have a celebration and encourage people to vaccinate beforehand, and to create a positive association for vaccines overall,” says Josh Morrison, co-founder of the vaccine-focused nonprofit group  .  The group formed in March 2020 to   — where volunteers would be deliberately infected with Covid-19 — as a way to learn more about the infection. To show people’s willingness to participate, 1Day Sooner signed up more than 30,000 people as a potential trial pool of applicants. In February 2021, the U.K.   the world’s first Covid-19 human challenge trial. Now 1Day Sooner is expanding its advocacy work to promote National Vaccine Day, an idea that also has the backing of four former surgeons general, who   encouraging the holiday to President Biden in early March. The   was Martin Luther King, Jr., Day, in 1983.  “We have to make getting vaccinated the coolest option. I think the buzz and anticipation of doing something fun will motivate many people who are vaccine-hesitant or uncertain,” says Keona Jeane Wynne, a doctoral student in population health sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a member of 1Day Sooner’s Vaccine Day initiative  .  To demonstrate how a national vaccine day could come together, 1Day Sooner has proposed rolling it out on a citywide scale in Boston.  , who is likely to become the   if   is confirmed as Biden’s Secretary of Labor, the group suggests implementing a Boston Vaccine Day earlier in the summer, as a “much-needed day of entertainment and social restoration.” The letter is co-signed by a group of nearly 60 other backers, among them a host of prominent public health experts and, curiously, actor Nick Offerman, who is better known as everyone’s favorite fake parks department director, Ron Swanson. (Mike Schur, creator of “Parks and Recreation,” also serves on the steering committee with Wynne.) Why Boston? Morrison is originally from Boston, and Wynne was already involved in vaccine advocacy work in the city even before joining 1Day Sooner. Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin also   the notion of a vaccine day in December. The Harvard Medical School Center for Bioethics as well as the Massachusetts Health Council and the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, two nonprofits, recently signed on as official partners. The city’s also been something of a national leader in the Covid-19 campaign:  “When you’re trying to show the value of this idea nationally, just having a bunch of PowerPoints doesn’t quite do it,” says Morrison. “You want to show how a city can do it in practice.”  The citywide celebration could serve as a template for pro-vaccine campaigns in other cities. Some public-health experts say the notion sounds promising. “One of the things that’s gotten lost in the noise is that we are less than a year later and we have three vaccines that are effective. That is amazing,” says Dr. Sophie Godley, clinical assistant professor of community health services at the Boston University School of Public Health. “I love the idea that we might celebrate that instead of being afraid of it.” Unconventional public-health campaigns to spread the word on vaccination aren’t a new phenomenon. When the polio vaccine became available in the mid-1950s, houses of worship in towns and cities across the U.S. rang their church bells in celebration. In the 1970s, the U.S. government   to promote measles vaccination: Posters featured C-3PO and R2D2 asking “parents of earth” if their kids were immunized. “We had big rollouts for measles and for rubella,” says Dr. Walter Orenstein, the former director of the U.S. National Immunization Program who’s now a professor of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine. “All that publicity, I think, is helpful, but I can’t prove it to you.”  Others applaud the idea of encouraging vaccination by connecting the shot to some tangible real-world benefit — like the prospect of screaming one’s head off in a crowded outdoor concert. That carrot-vs-stick approach is something that has been lacking in the national vaccine effort, says Dr. Leana Wen, a professor of public health policy at George Washington University.  “One of the problems thus far in our coronavirus response is the lack of excitement,” says Wen, who previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner. “We should be much more proactive about the freedoms we can now enjoy as a result of being vaccinated.” Even if a large share of Americans are vaccinated, serious risks   around fast-spreading variants. For that reason, Morrison says the basic safety precepts that became commonplace over the last year — distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing — should still be hallmarks of Vaccine Day observances.  “One of the things that we were wrestling with at the beginning was like, are we advocating for a day where everyone can go get vaccinated or are we advocating to celebrate being vaccinated?” Wynne says. “We ended up with the latter, which is we’re celebrating being vaccinated. The goal was to set the holiday at far enough out to where it was feasible, for enough of the population to have been vaccinated. But that definitely still doesn’t solve the problem of distribution and equity and things of that nature.” Those are issues outside of the group’s hands. But after counting the days spent apart from friends, family, and coworkers for more than a year, a National Vaccine Day set for late summer could still give the country something powerful to reach for in what may be the final months of the pandemic: a finish line.  “All of us in public health said, ‘Just hang on two months.’ And then it was another two months, and then it was Christmas, and then it was this year,” says Wynne. “There’s a lot of hesitancy to set a date because no one wants to be wrong. So really, this holiday is to say, ‘This is the benchmark.’”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/-vaccine-day-could-promise-a-pandemic-finish-line,"[{'id': '9895320Z:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.48976535197204196, 'directScore': 0.48976535197204196}, {'id': 'AONE:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.7297803295057415, 'directScore': 0.7297803295057415}, {'id': '0328962Z:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.8282576135796306, 'directScore': 0.8282576135796306}, {'id': 'washington', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.20931103344982527, 'directScore': 0.20931103344982527}, {'id': 'north-america', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.44196205691462803, 'directScore': 0.44196205691462803}, {'id': 'new-england', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.45207189216175736, 'directScore': 0.45207189216175736}, {'id': 'massachusetts', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.9850224663005492, 'directScore': 0.9850224663005492}, {'id': 'christmas', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.02234148776834748, 'directScore': 0.02234148776834748}, {'id': 'policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.21143285072391413, 'directScore': 0.21143285072391413}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.37974245423243747, 'directScore': 0.30691462805791314}, {'id': 'entertainment', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5667748377433849, 'directScore': 0.5667748377433849}, {'id': 'labor', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.4328507239141288, 'directScore': 1.4328507239141288}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.293310034947579, 'directScore': 3.293310034947579}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.77309036445332, 'directScore': 4.77309036445332}, {'id': 'public-health', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6.442710933599601, 'directScore': 6.442710933599601}, {'id': 'us-republicans', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 0.9169995007488767, 'directScore': 0.9169995007488767}, {'id': 'food-and-drug-administration', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 1.8533449825262107, 'directScore': 1.8533449825262107}, {'id': 'baltimore', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.1918372441337993, 'directScore': 0.1918372441337993}, {'id': 'boston', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 5.121247815776336, 'directScore': 5.121247815776336}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.7297803295057415, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'politics', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.9169995007488767, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 8.210785883883641, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'culture', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.0655458125493613, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 1.2771794359771373, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'science', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9730616552567171, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.2771794359771373, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'media-and-entertainment', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5667748377433849, 'directScore': 0}]"
Record-Breaking Wildfires Made North American Air Worse in 2020," The devastating wildfires that torched a record 4.3 million acres in the U.S. in 2020 made North America the only region in the world where air quality was worse than during the previous year.  Most of the world's major cities had better air last year than in 2019, mainly thanks to coronavirus lockdowns that cleared skies for weeks or months, according to the annual report by air quality platform IQAir. Though India’s New Delhi was the most-polluted capital city, its pollution levels nevertheless fell 16% from the previous year.  Los Angeles, Melbourne and Sao Paulo, all of which were close to major wildfires in 2020, were among the few where pollution was worse than in 2019. In the U.S., 38% of cities had levels of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, that exceeded World Health Organization quality standards in 2020, up from 21% the previous year. Skies in the western coast were so choked with wildfire smoke during September that 77 of the world’s 100 most polluted cities that month were in the U.S.    High exposure to PM2.5, which is emitted by fossil-fuel powered vehicles, industrial activity and biomass burning, can cause asthma, lung cancer, heart disease, and has been associated with low birth weight, acute respiratory infections and strokes, IQAir said. An increasing amount of studies are also linking worsening air pollution to increased vulnerability to Covid-19, which attacks respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Coronavirus deaths attributable to long-term air pollution exposure could represent between 7% and 33% of all fatalities due to the virus, according to an   published in Cardiovascular Research and cited by IQAir. “We know that when there is a wildfire, there will be increases in respiratory and cardiac events. We see increases in ER visits and hospitalizations for things such as asthma, exacerbation, for pneumonia, for acute bronchitis,” said Dr. Mary Prunicki, who studies the impacts of air pollution on allergies and the immune system at Stanford University. The 2020 fire season “was the worst air quality the Bay Area has ever experienced, and for the longest duration.” The San Francisco Bay Area saw a total of 25 days with unsafe levels of particulate matter pollution in the air for a 24-hour period, a record according to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. Residents felt the impact of this air pollution in a visceral way on Sept. 9, when wildfire smoke combined with clouds and fog to block out the sun and cast an eerie, “ ” orange hue over the sky. The same fumes also contain greenhouse gases that are warming the planet and in turn are making wildfires more frequent and intense.  Elsewhere, once-in-a-decade sandstorms in China’s northwestern Xinjiang province polluted cities in the region for months and sent dust as far as Beijing. The desert oasis city of Hotan had the highest particle pollution worldwide for several months because of the sandstorms, according to IQAir. Overall, 86% of Chinese cities had cleaner air last year, but pollution levels are returning to pre-pandemic levels, according to satellite data published Monday by the European Space Agency.  IQAir’s analysis also suggests that as cities tightened lockdowns last year, pollution tended to improve, and these gains were lost when movement restrictions eased. This indicates 2020’s improvements will prove fleeting without significant changes to the energy mix and to human behavior. Wildfires and other discrete events further complicate the idea that a mass reduction in certain human activity is all that’s needed to improve air quality, Dr. K. Max Zhang, a professor at Cornell University who researched pollution in six Chinese cities during lockdown. While he finds hope in the fact that most countries did see a reduction in particulate pollution last year, he says a larger climate mitigation is needed. “Covid in some ways gave us a reality check,” Zhang says. “If our efforts are concentrated just on cutting down travel, for example, that probably won’t get as much benefit as we had hoped.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/record-breaking-wildfires-made-north-american-air-worse-in-2020,"[{'id': 'north-america', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 1.4263956023911584, 'directScore': 1.4263956023911584}, {'id': 'beijing', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.330367876893484, 'directScore': 0.330367876893484}, {'id': 'san-francisco', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.4929069487857658, 'directScore': 0.4929069487857658}, {'id': 'melbourne', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.8684779995191152, 'directScore': 0.8684779995191152}, {'id': 'los-angeles', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.8713633084876172, 'directScore': 0.8713633084876172}, {'id': 'delhi', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.8980524164462611, 'directScore': 0.8980524164462611}, {'id': '20981330', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.8651118057225294, 'directScore': 0.8651118057225294}, {'id': '0725425D:FP', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.2548689588843472, 'directScore': 0.2548689588843472}, {'id': '0751538D:SW', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.8143784563597019, 'directScore': 0.8143784563597019}, {'id': 'stanford-university', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 0.6246693916806925, 'directScore': 0.6246693916806925}, {'id': 'travel', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.018033181053137774, 'directScore': 0.018033181053137774}, {'id': 'greenhouse-gases', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.39047848040394323, 'directScore': 0.39047848040394323}, {'id': 'cancer', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7251743207501803, 'directScore': 0.7251743207501803}, {'id': 'air-quality', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.760038470786246, 'directScore': 3.760038470786246}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.682375571050734, 'directScore': 4.682375571050734}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.2596778071651835, 'directScore': 5.2596778071651835}, {'id': 'air-pollution', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.451310411156527, 'directScore': 5.451310411156527}, {'id': 'CN', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.5861986054339986, 'directScore': 0.5861986054339986}, {'id': 'IN', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.8999759557585958, 'directScore': 0.8999759557585958}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.8542605196040786, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'FR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.2548689588843472, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 5.2596778071651835, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg-concerns', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.465295437889413, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.0908859477500583, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 1.0908859477500583, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.2548689588843472, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'brics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.0908859477500583, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'science', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.8729974343093287, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'aerospace-industry', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.2548689588843472, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'CH', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.8143784563597019, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'materials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.2548689588843472, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'climate-change', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.465295437889413, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'megacity', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.3000773471380112, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8143784563597019, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets-economics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.0908859477500583, 'directScore': 0}]"
New York’s Hottest Race Is for City Council," Rodrigo Camarena is a longtime immigrant advocate and community activist in South Brooklyn. In 2020, he helped lead the fight to stop  , a $1 billion project to rezone a swath of Sunset Park for commercial development; many residents of this heavily Hispanic, formerly industrial waterfront neighborhood feared the project would bring gentrification and displacement to a community that had already  .  The dire events of the past year helped convince Camarena, who came to New York from Mexico at age 4, that it was time for him to take his advocacy into a new arena: Instead of trying to pressure elected officials, he decided he needed to take their place. “I’ve learned a lot during my time as an activist organizer and public servant, and to me, it’s important to bring my background to influence decisions at a city level,” he says. “That will help us take the lessons of that moment, to ensure the impact the pandemic has had on so many of our neighbors doesn’t happen again.”  So last summer, he jumped into the race for an open New York City Council seat, representing the city’s 38th District. He’s basing his campaign on a pledge to create the “ .” “New Yorkers of color, the working poor, and immigrants have been hurting for a very long time — anybody involved or paying attention knows that,” he says. “2020 showed us how that vulnerability so many New Yorkers have had for so many years can lead to deadly outcomes.”  Camarena’s campaign reflects an activist energy that has seen many first-time candidates step up to  . “People who are running for office this year, activated by 2020, are really thinking about fundamental, radical, structural change, and what that looks like,” Camarena says.  Since the pandemic arrived last March, New York City has played a starring role — first as an infection hotspot, then a symbol of the inequities that Covid-19 exposed. As one of the first high-profile, truly post-2020 municipal elections, the city’s June primaries will offer an early political test for a progressive movement fired up to fix the ills highlighted by this once-in-a-generation crisis. While the fight to succeed the term-limited de Blasio for mayor is attracting more notice —   — the city council races could be a better barometer of the direction of municipal politics. At least 32 of 51 seats will be open due to term limits or retirements, compared to 9 in 2017, and roughly 300 candidates have announced city council candidacies. For the first time, the city will use  , which   to the city’s  . There’s a strong potential that the council could move further left, highlighting the battle between mainstream Democratic politicians and its more activist wing around the direction of policy in U.S. cities. “We see a bubble bursting,” says Tiffany Cabán, an attorney, activist and candidate for District 22 in Queens, the borough where her   helped earn her national name recognition. “Movements, in general, are an ecosystem. We work long and hard for small gains. Right now, we’re in a time of a lot of activity and growth.” Progressive groups have endorsed multiple candidates, including 21 by the Working Families Party and 6 by the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. (On the state level, a recently elected   also foreshadows more progressive shifts.) “We really have an opportunity to make this a city for all New Yorkers,” says Chi Anunwa, co-chair of NYC DSA. “It’s going to be a long process, but we have to start somewhere, and on some level, time is of the essence.”  Kumar Rao, senior director of policy and strategy for the WFP in New York City, calls this year a moment of “transition, crisis and opportunity” for progressives in U.S. cities. The sites of large-scale demonstrations after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, cities grappled with interconnected, overlapping crises around  , housing and criminal justice as the nation exited the Trump era and pivoted to the Biden presidency. While an anticipated “blue wave” didn’t fully materialize last November,   at the local level in 2020. “This election will be less of a referendum on the era of Mayor Bill de Blasio than people wanting answers for the future,” says Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, and contributing editor of   “Voters want answers. How do I get back to work, if my job isn’t coming back? What’s going on with public safety in my neighborhood? People don’t want to dwell on 2020.” The potential progressive city council class of 2021 is a notably diverse one, filled with immigrants and first- and second-generation Americans, along with other underrepresented groups.  , running in District 37 covering Bushwick and East New York in Brooklyn, is a Panamanian-born Afro-Latina who founded  . Crystal Hudson, competing to represent the 35th, which covers Prospect Heights and Crown Heights, is a former marketing and advertising manager who   and hopes to be the city’s first gay, Black, female councilmember.  , an Ozone Park native, educator and daughter of a taxi driver, aims to represent her home turf in District 32 in eastern Queens. In District 39, which includes the pricey brownstones of Brooklyn’s Park Slope,  , a Bangladeshi immigrant and community outreach organizer for the district’s outgoing progressive councilmember Brad Lander, seeks to be the first South Asian and Muslim woman on the council. There are common policy threads running through these candidates’ experiences: Most support a Green New Deal for New York, immigrant rights, criminal justice reform, as well as housing justice and the   Development policies and affordable housing have emerged as some of the more significant issues, especially in light of the estimates that show New York City renters are carrying   into this year. The DSA’s Anunwa says that tenant groups has been an effective way to muster support for other progressive causes, and the passage of rent stabilization and an eviction moratorium show that while the socialist group may not have a legislative majority, its “inside-outside” political strategy has paid dividends.  The leftward shift in NYC politics shouldn’t come as a surprise after the events of the past year, Nurse says: Large businesses, especially in the gig economy, have profited off delivery workers and others who tend to be immigrants, unprotected and unable to get public services and benefits because of their status. “The next city government will be governing through both a protracted crisis and a new government at the federal level,” she says. “We need fighters who can go hard and protect those living on the margins in this city.” It’s easy to make comparisons to other recent NY progressive victories, namely the new wave of federal representatives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman. But Gelinas warns that many of these candidates are trying to in effect nationalize local races — focusing on bigger picture ideological issues instead of traditional topics such as development, safety, and schools — which is harder to do for a city council race.  “Electing someone like AOC, it’s understood that you can afford to make a protest vote and take a slight risk with your vote for Congress,” she says. “Representatives don’t make a lot of decisions that directly affect your life. People want something else from their city council members — answers to quality of life issues and public safety.” Without a huge turnout of new voters, council races will be much closer that many of these new candidates think, says Gelinas, who also sees a potential fracture between progressive upstarts and the city’s powerful police and teachers’ unions, which have been in the middle of fierce debates on school reopenings and police reform. “The general progressive rhetoric is that we need a stronger public safety net for everyone, while public sector unions have been focused on getting better benefits for their own members,” Gelinas says.  Rao believes the WFP and other progressive groups can indeed bring out these voters who typically don’t come out because they feel untapped or left out of politics. Activist groups, labor and interest groups like New York Immigration Coalition Action have  . “There’s an energy in young people in their 20s now, that hasn’t traditionally been part of city council voter outreach,” he says. “This new generation coming into politics has been much more immersed in the political world just having grown up during the post-Obama, social media era.” These voters in particular, activated by 2020, hunger for systemic change, he says. “It’s easy to put up a video and make a powerful digital ad using the images of last year, tapping into the passion and emotion that all raised,” says Rao. “But it’s very different to present ideas that really aim to change the way we do things.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/progressives-are-watching-nyc-s-city-council-race,"[{'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.5999243300708037, 'directScore':

"Redlined, Now Flooding"," For the full experience visit:  For the full experience visit:  Flooding is a rising threat across the U.S., with homeowners facing as much as $19 billion in damages every year. What puts a neighborhood at high risk for flooding? Geography is key, but new data reveal another factor that can be determinative, too: Race. Contemporary maps for flood risk overlap in striking ways with New Deal–era maps used by the federal government to assess risk for mortgage lending. When appraisers mapped cities for the federal Homeowners’ Loan Corporation in the 1930s, they assigned grades to neighborhoods based on several factors, race high among them. Black and immigrant neighborhoods were deemed undesirable, marked by yellow or red lines designating these areas “declining” or “hazardous”—a racist practice known as redlining. These historically redlined neighborhoods suffer a far higher risk of flooding today, according to new research from Redfin, the Seattle-based real-estate brokerage. Using flood risk data from the nonprofit First Street Foundation and redlining maps from the University of Richmond’s Mapping Inequality project, Redfin assessed racial disparities in flood risk across dozens of major metro areas. Consider Sacramento. The California capital region with a population of more than 2 million had the highest racial flood risk disparity in Redfin’s analysis.",https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-flood-risk-redlining,"[{'id': 'sacramento', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.1060931899641577, 'directScore': 0.1060931899641577}, {'id': 'richmond', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.2, 'directScore': 0.2}, {'id': 'california', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.09462365591397849, 'directScore': 0.09462365591397849}, {'id': 'equality', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.1863799283154122, 'directScore': 0.1863799283154122}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6243727598566309, 'directScore': 0.6243727598566309}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6752688172043011, 'directScore': 0.6752688172043011}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'luxury', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'well-spent', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.174345914460974, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'science', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.8729974343093287, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'personal-finance', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.174345914460974, 'directScore': 0}]"
"Greenwashing Rules, Bank Pledges May Signal a New Day for Europe"," The biggest Nordic bank plans to reduce its holdings of oil and gas stocks. The largest French insurer dropped RWE AG as a client because of the German energy giant’s reliance on coal. HSBC Holdings Plc announced plans to scale back its lending to fossil-fuel companies   from shareholders. And the European Union has introduced new rules intended to crack down on greenwashing by managers of investment funds. All four of these decisions surfaced in the past week. While none may ultimately result in lower greenhouse-gas emissions, they are signs that Europe’s largest financial institutions are   making the right noises about fighting climate change. They’re certainly being more proactive than their counterparts on Wall Street.  , Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. continue to be   of the companies and industries most responsible for, and profiting from, the accelerating atmospheric catastrophe facing the planet. But some observers are   that the reluctance of America’s financial industry to do more to slow global warming will soon fade. “While we’ve so far seen an earlier and more policy and regulation-driven response to the climate crisis in Europe, we expect the U.S. to  , especially in light of the new administration in the White House,” said Marie Freier, global head of ESG research at Barclays Plc. In Finland, Nordea AB said it will restrict more than 200 of its funds that manage a combined 120 billion euros ($143 billion) from holding oil and gas stocks. To avoid being cut, an energy company must prove it’s on what Eric Pedersen, Nordea’s head of responsible investments, described as “ .” Shares of BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Equinor ASA and Total SE have already been sold off for failing to meet the criteria, according to the bank. French insurer Axa SA’s decision to dump RWE, one of Europe’s biggest coal mine operators, was precedent-setting for the global insurance industry, said Peter Bosshard, finance program director at environmental nonprofit the Sunrise Project. Scientists estimate coal use in electric-power generation must fall 80% below 2010 levels to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages, which is the more ambitious target of the Paris Agreement.  HSBC ranks as Europe’s   for fossil-fuel producing energy companies since the signing of the Paris accord in late 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show. This prompted a group of the bank’s shareholders, including Amundi SA and Man Group Plc, to file a resolution in January requesting the London-based bank cut its support for the energy industry. After at least two months of talks, the group withdrew its resolution when HSBC proposed its own, agreeing to disclose short- and medium-term targets for aligning its lending and underwriting with the Paris Agreement. The bank also said it intends to phase out financing for coal-fired power plants and thermal coal mining in the European Union and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states by 2030, and then in the rest of the world before 2040. This all assumes shareholders back the company’s resolution at the May 28 annual meeting—and that if they do, HSBC follows through. And finally in Brussels,   to ensure that fund mangers don’t label funds as being environmentally compliant when they aren’t—that ubiquitous corporate practice of greenwashing. By mandating greater disclosures, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, or SFDR, is aimed at   among financial firms hoping to cash in on the booming market for such funds. The expectation among those such as Marie Freier of Barclays is that more companies and investment firms (even those in the U.S.) will   ahead of the COP26 event in November in Glasgow, Scotland, where climate finance will be a central theme. Still, the question is will these efforts result in a significant financial shift away from fossil fuels and a consequential drop in greenhouse-gas emissions, or just more greenwashing? Efforts by the EU and other regulators to police these green pledges may be critical to any success. The clock is ticking.

Minister Sees ‘Compelling Reasons’ to Block U.K. Coal Mine," Business Secretary  Kwasi Kwarteng  said there are “very compelling reasons” to scrap plans for the U.K.’s first new deep coal mine in three decades, amid an outcry over environmental concerns. Initially, ministers decided not to intervene in a proposal for a mine for coking coal to be used in the steel industry, in Cumbria, northwest England. But after campaigners and the government’s own advisers on the Climate Change Committee (CCC) said the plan undermined  Boris Johnson ’s green credentials, ministers decided to review it. Now Kwarteng, one of the most senior members of Johnson’s government, suggested the decision to stop the proposal going ahead had effectively been taken. His comments are likely to be controversial as the government review has not yet been completed. Asked why ministers did not simply announce they’re blocking the plan, Kwarteng told BBC radio on Wednesday: “Essentially what we’ve done is pretty much that.” He continued: “We’re looking at it, it’s part of a planning process. Initially I think the relevant secretary of state said we wouldn’t go against the local planning decision but he’s now looking again and I think there are very compelling reasons to do what the CCC suggested and not open the mine.” Kwarteng said he was “always sympathetic” to the CCC, adding: “Our goals are largely aligned.” His comments came as the government unveiled plans to slash the amount of carbon dioxide spewed out by factories and other industrial processes by two-thirds within the next 15 years. The government   in the planning decision over whether to build the controversial mine -- snarling up planning for West Cumbria Mining Ltd.’s Woodhouse Colliery in Whitehaven. The proposal has already been considered three times by the local council. Cumbria County Council supported the mine in October, a decision backed by Communities Secretary  Robert Jenrick  at the time. The council then  , saying it needed to reconsider the proposal in the light of the latest advice from the CCC, which in December recommended a “carbon budget” for the U.K. that included an emissions reduction of 78% by 2035, relative to 1990 levels. Jenrick’s department cited that as a reason for calling in the decision on the mine. But the move was met with fury by some Conservative members of Parliament.

Iberdrola Raises Bet on Japanese Offshore Wind Market,"  added to its growing portfolio of global offshore wind projects with its latest acquisition off the coast of Japan. The Spanish utility will develop the 600-megawatt Seihoku-oki wind farm with Japanese developer  Cosmo Eco Power Co Ltd  and Hitz engineering, the company said in a statement. It grows Iberdrola’s overall pipeline in Japan to 3.9 gigawatts, part of its strategy to become the world’s largest renewable power company. The wind farm off the coast of Aomori prefecture in northern Japan is currently under development and will enter a capacity auction planned by the Japanese government to take place by 2022. A representative for Iberdrola declined to disclose the financial details of the deal. Japan is looking to rapidly scale up its offshore wind industry from almost nothing today to 10 gigawatts by 2030 and 45 gigawatts in 2040. Iberdrola wants to lock in its position as a major player in the country.

"India Considers 2050 Net-Zero Target, a Decade Before China"," Top Indian government officials are debating whether to set a goal to zero out its  greenhouse gas emissions  by mid-century, an ambitious target that would require overhauling its coal-dependent economy. Officials close to Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  are working with senior bureaucrats and foreign advisers to consider ways to meet the 2050 deadline, according to people familiar with the matter. A 2047 target is also being considered, they said, to mark the centenary of India’s independence from British rule. The people asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. India, the world’s third-biggest emitter, has come under pressure to make a net-zero pledge ahead of global climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, this year. Signatories of the Paris Agreement are expected to boost their commitments to slow global warming, and China -- the biggest polluter and a rival of India -- won international praise for   a 2060 net-zero target in September. The timing and scope of India’s announcement could depend on pledges other nations make on April 22, when U.S. President  Joe Biden  is set to gather world leaders for an Earth Day summit. The event is the first such meeting Biden will host as president, and he’s asked climate envoy  John Kerry  to secure fresh commitments from attendees. “Every single country has to step up ambition,” Kerry   during his visit to the U.K. earlier this month. He explicitly included India while singling out “the 20 countries that are the equivalent of 81% of global emissions.” The Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change in New Delhi didn’t immediately respond to requests seeking comment. Once the U.S. adopts a widely anticipated net-zero goal, nine of the 10 largest economies will have made pledges to neutralize about 60% of global emissions. If India does so, too, it would mark a significant step in the fight against climate change -- though experts warn that a 2050 target will be extremely difficult to achieve. There are signs that support is growing domestically for India to set a net-zero goal. Jayant Sinha , a member of parliament with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, said on March 12 that he had submitted a private members’ bill in the parliament that would make a 2050 target legally binding. On March 16, T.S. Singh Deo, a cabinet minister for the eastern state of Chhattisgarh, said the area’s health sector is setting a 2050 net-zero target. Non-governmental institutions in India have started using models to work out potential pathways to net-zero emissions, two of the people familiar said, but the research is at an early stage and does not cover the entire economy. The country needs more information before it can credibly set such a target, according to Navroz Dubash, a professor at the Centre for Policy Research and editor of the book ‘India in a Warming World’. “We don’t know exactly how we will do it and what are the potential trade-offs with development objectives.” The International Energy Agency’s modeling shows a potential path for India to approach net-zero emissions in the mid-2060s. That’s based on the think tank’s Sustainable Development Scenario, which meets the Paris Agreement objective of keeping global warming to “well below 2°C,” but does not reach the more ambitious goal of keeping it to 1.5°C. A new model for 1.5°C is set to be released in May and may show possible ways for all countries, including India, to zero out emissions sooner. Over the past decades, developing countries have contributed far less greenhouse gases to the atmosphere than nations that industrialized earlier. As of 2018, India ranked seventh among top historical polluters, after the U.S., China, Russia, Germany, the U.K. and Japan. Even the Paris accord acknowledges this reality, noting that nations have “common but differentiated responsibilities.” The clause has been used to support arguments that rich countries should cut their emissions faster, allowing poorer countries to use fossil fuels for a bit longer to help them achieve the prosperity which the West has enjoyed for decades. “For countries such as India, the most important thing is to achieve the greatest development for the fewest additional emissions,” said Dubash. Instead of setting a distant net-zero goal, India should “figure out ways to avoid locking in high-carbon infrastructure,” he said. For example, the nation hasn’t set a target for peaking its use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. Some Indian officials want to see what the U.S. says about the Paris goals at the April 22 meeting before making any commitment, including whether Western nations change the Paris goalposts in any way, the people said. India’s existing commitments are already relatively ambitious, with nonprofit Climate Action Tracker giving it the best rating among large economies. The country wants to expand renewable power to 450 gigawatts by 2030, almost five times existing capacity, and to cut emissions intensity by at least a third from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Achieving net-zero emissions would require India to set even more aggressive renewable energy targets, electrify not only its transport sector but most industrial processes, find solutions for hard-to-abate sectors like construction and agriculture, and dramatically boost commitments to reduce consumption of almost every conceivable product. With a growing population and still-industrializing economy, a net-zero goal for India will be a much bigger lift than for most economies. “The country may not agree to any net-zero targets by 2050 without external financial support,” said BloombergNEF analyst  Shantanu Jaiswal . Modi will also need to navigate potential pushback from inside his government. India’s Power Ministry   a drive to cap toxic emissions from power plants, arguing the sector couldn’t meet an original 2017 deadline to make improvements on discharges of pollutants like sulfur dioxide and mercury. There is no consensus among ministries over the net-zero target, the people familiar said, with some officials arguing that India shouldn’t bow to pressure given its fossil fuel use is set to rise in the coming decade. Still, Modi has surprised his own government before with policy announcements that have had wide-ranging impact. In 2016, he shocked the nation by banning some 86% of currency notes overnight in a landmark demonetization program, while last year he gave no warning in   the country to stem the spread of the coronavirus. While a net-zero goal would offer clarity on India’s climate stance, it won’t succeed without short-term targets, said Jonathan Elkind, a senior research scholar at Columbia University. Without clear policy routes, he said, “any long-term goal will remain elusive.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/india-considers-net-zero-goal-around-2050-a-decade-before-china,"[{'id': 'XW1:COM', 'type': 'Commodity', 'derivedScore':

Record Carbon Not Enough to Curb Germany’s Dirtiest Power Plants," Electricity generated in Germany from lignite, one of the most carbon-heavy fuels, has increased during 2021 spurred by higher power prices. Even a rally in carbon emission permit prices to record levels hasn’t been enough to curb output from the dirtiest fossil fuel. Electricity generated by lignite plants in Germany has increased by 35% so far this year, compared with same period in 2020, according to data compiled by research institute Fraunhofer ISE. The profitability of lignite plants takes account of the cost of mining the fuel and buying carbon permits in relation to the market price for the power sold. Because lignite is so cheap to produce, as long as prices for electricity are higher than for carbon then stations using the fuel will be in the money, according to Fraunhofer. Every megawatt-hour of power produced from lignite causes about 1.1 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, according to Bruno Burger, a professor at Fraunhofer. With average day-ahead power prices 77% higher this year compared with 2020, the spread over carbon has widened in 2021, keeping lignite profitable. Coal accounts for about a third of all generation in Germany. The nation has a road map to close scores of plants by 2038 under a phase-out plan that will cost taxpayers at least $55 billion, including direct compensation to utilities. Big lignite operators such as RWE AG and  LEAG  sell forward most of their their power output and buy carbon permits years in advance. RWE expects its lignite operations to be cash-flow positive on average from 2023 onwards, according to an investor presentation on March 16. Lignite generation has been needed to fill the supply gap left after four gigawatts of hard coal capacity was   at the start of the year and calm weather cut output from wind turbines. Wind generation has averaged about 16 gigawatts a day so far this year down from 23 gigawatts in 2020, according to S&P Global Platts. Generation from cleaner-burning natural gas is also up by more than a third this year, Fraunhofer data show. Carbon prices above 40 euros ($47.60) a ton have helped gas plants push out hard coal, lignite’s more-expensive cousin, in the power generation merit order. While lignite still remains the cheapest fossil fuel source, natural gas will be a key influence on power prices. “Variable power generation mainly leads to volatile prices but the absolute price level is determined by the margin cost for thermal power, mainly gas generation,” Arne Bergvik, chief analyst at Swedish utility Jamtkraft AB, said. Marginal costs for a gas-fired plant in Germany with 50% efficiency have risen to 52 euros a megawatt-hour on average in the first quarter compared with about 30 euros in 2020, according to S&P Global Platts. Carbon costs have made up nearly 15 euros of these costs this quarter compared with 9 euros in 2020.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/record-carbon-not-enough-to-curb-germany-s-dirtiest-power-plants,"[{'id': '7279225Z:SS', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.11504424778761062, 'directScore': 0.11504424778761062}, {'id': 'RWE:GR', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 1.0056637168141593, 'directScore': 1.0056637168141593}, {'id': 'NG1:COM', 'type': 'Commodity', 'derivedScore': 0.5153982300884956, 'directScore': 0.5153982300884956}, {'id': 'XW1:COM', 'type': 'Commodity', 'derivedScore': 1.2711504424778761, 'directScore': 1.2711504424778761}, {'id': 'utilities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5352212389380531, 'directScore': 0.5352212389380531}, {'id': 'wind-turbines', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7391150442477876, 'directScore': 0.7391150442477876}, {'id': 'fossil-fuel', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.6768141592920354, 'directScore': 2.6768141592920354}, {'id': 'power-plants', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 10.189411792997307, 'directScore': 10.189411792997307}, {'id': 'DE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 8.79700444002635, 'directScore': 8.739140655059638}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.6221243045338682, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'energy', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 2.9019608834422073, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 8.7750705705827, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg-concerns', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.766453061769022, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5352212389380531, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'climate-change', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.766453061769022, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'futures-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.3756366333730097, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.6221243045338682, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'SE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.11504424778761062, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'commodity-futures', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.3756366333730097, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'carbon-emissions', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6927433628318584, 'directScore': 0}]"
Pandemic Makes U.S. Spring Party Season a Time of Risky Revelry," The convergence of St. Patrick’s Day, spring break and the sunset of mask mandates is creating fresh fear of a  Covid-19  resurgence in the U.S., even as cases drop and vaccinations accelerate. Last week, Miami Beach police arrested hundreds as spring break lured an influx of visitors, breaking up at least one crowd with pepper balls. In Savannah, Georgia, bars are teeming with people celebrating the city’s Irish heritage. Houston authorities quashed plans for barefaced parties to mark the end of Texas’s mask mandate. The revelry comes a full year into the pandemic, as vaccines have reached more than 65% of U.S. seniors and estimates suggest more than 83 million Americans have already been infected. Yet Covid-19 is still prevalent, and the highly infectious B.1.1.7 variant is dominant in states such as Florida and Texas. “We have the knowledge and we have the tools to keep cases on this steady downward trajectory while people are being vaccinated,” said Julie Fischer, a microbiologist with global health nonprofit CRDF Global. “People just need to hold on for a little bit longer.” While scientists and health officials have been pleading with the public to continue mask-wearing and social distancing, they may meet their match in spring breezes and the lure of green-dyed beer. Even though the most famous St. Patrick’s parades have all been canceled, the bars in many cities are expected to fill up Wednesday. In Savannah, a gracious colonial-era city on Georgia’s Atlantic coast, there’s a six-day festival promoted by the Plant Riverside entertainment district. Savannah’s holiday in normal years is a green-splashed bacchanal, but this year the maskless partying “flies in the face of what we’ve been trying to do here in terms of keeping people safe,” Mayor  Van Johnson  said in an interview Tuesday. “You have a population across the country of people who are weary of Covid-19,” Johnson said. “We expect them to enjoy Savannah, but we expect that they will respect our city and our residents by social distancing and particularly wearing a mask in public spaces.” The governors of Mississippi and Texas lifted mask mandates this month, bringing to 15 the number of states without one, and Google data show the nation is about halfway back to its mobility patterns before the first lockdown. In places such as Georgia and Florida, Republican governors have also stripped local officials of the power to punish risky behavior. Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said municipal workers are going to the beach to distribute masks and gave away some 7,000 just Saturday. But it   like “swimming upstream,“ in part because Florida Governor  Ron DeSantis  prevented cities from fining people for Covid rule violations. “We’re very serious about keeping order, and we don’t want people coming here thinking this is a place to go wild,” Gelber said Tuesday. “We’re clearly near the end, a lot of people are getting the vaccine and they’re also fatigued and antsy.” It is, he said, “a very perilous mix.” One thing may help: Some schools have shortened or canceled spring break altogether. Duke University, for example, gave only two days off last week. The Durham, North Carolina, school is battling outbreaks on its own campus, where this weekend undergraduates were ordered to quarantine for a week after fraternity gatherings fueled cases. The surge represented the largest one-week number of positive tests and quarantines since the start of the pandemic, the school said in a statement. Americans have been warned time and again about mass gatherings, but Covid-19 has become so prevalent and contact-tracing is so poor that it’s often impossible to identify discrete outbreaks associated with particular events like street parties or sporting events. What’s more, the targeted vaccination of the most vulnerable suggests the U.S. won’t necessarily see another pronounced spike in deaths before July. Even in a scenario in which fast-spreading variants and relaxed behavior drive a significant rebound in cases, the corresponding increase in deaths would probably be very slight, according to estimates from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Analysis. Still, even a gentle surge -- as opposed to the expected decline -- would mean 55,000 more lives lost. Fischer, the microbiologist, said Americans now have the tools to keep cases trending downward, and it would be a shame to let more people die unnecessarily. “We are not in the clear yet,” she said. “It’s as if both the pilots and the passengers agree that since they can see airport, they no longer need to keep flying the plane.” Despite the high-visibility parties, Americans as a whole are somewhat careful. As of March 8, about 73% always wear a mask outside their homes, according to survey data provided by the IHME. The challenge will be in sustaining that compliance for at least several more months. President  Joe Biden  has said that all Americans will be eligible to seek a Covid-19 vaccine by May 1 and should return to a semblance of normal life by Independence Day. In Savannah, some people have clearly gotten ahead of that timeline. Hotels were about 90% full last weekend and running about 80% full now, according to Johnson, the mayor. Still, the overall visitor traffic of about 30,000 to 50,000 people pales in comparison to a normal year, and Johnson said residents shouldn’t risk their well-being this year “for a day or two of reckless folly.” Save it up, he said, for 2022. “We are 366 days away from the largest St. Patrick’s Day parade and festival that the   has ever seen, in the Irish capital of America: Savannah, Georgia. The clock starts now.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/pandemic-makes-u-s-spring-party-season-a-time-of-risky-revelry,"[{'id': 'riverside', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.7150753768844221, 'directScore': 0.7150753768844221}, {'id': 'houston', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.9299832495812396, 'directScore': 0.9299832495812396}, {'id': 'miami', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 1.7722873638145678, 'directScore': 1.4500837520938021}, {'id': '13387985', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.1254606365159129, 'directScore': 0.1254606365159129}, {'id': '17685322', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.5001675041876047, 'directScore': 0.5001675041876047}, {'id': '17233904', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 1.4268006700167506, 'directScore': 1.4268006700167506}, {'id': 'washington', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.2534338358458961, 'directScore': 0.2534338358458961}, {'id': 'north-carolina', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.41557788944723617, 'directScore': 0.41557788944723617}, {'id': 'mississippi', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.6068676716917923, 'directScore': 0.6068676716917923}, {'id': 'miami-beach', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.9666666666666667, 'directScore': 0.9666666666666667}, {'id': 'florida', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 1.9179229480737017, 'directScore': 1.9179229480737017}, {'id': 'texas', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 2.3675041876046903, 'directScore': 2.3675041876046903}, {'id': 'us-republicans', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 0.5656616415410385, 'directScore': 0.5656616415410385}, {'id': 'AONE:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.44187604690117255, 'directScore': 0.44187604690117255}, {'id': 'GOOGL:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.5891122278056952, 'directScore': 0.5891122278056952}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.6419804055077285, 'directScore': 1.4599664991624792}, {'id': 'GE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 2.244221105527638, 'directScore': 2.244221105527638}, {'id': 'entertainment', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7134003350083752, 'directScore': 0.7134003350083752}, {'id': 'beer', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7577889447236181, 'directScore': 0.7577889447236181}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.5262981574539363, 'directScore': 3.5262981574539363}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.20455451862487, 'directScore': 4.20455451862487}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.44187604690117255, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'politics', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.5656616415410385, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 2.244221105527638, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 4.20455451862487, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 1.6419804055077285, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'well-spent', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'science', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.348691828921949, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'personal-finance', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'media-and-entertainment', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7134003350083752, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'technology', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.5891122278056952, 'directScore': 0}]"
Europe Carmakers Shrug Off Worst Sales Since 2013 on EV Optimism," Europe’s automakers are shrugging off depressed sales at home as investors take a more bullish view of their electric-vehicle prospects. The  Stoxx 600 Automobiles & Parts Index  climbed Wednesday to an almost three-year high even after the industry’s trade group reported worst February for new-car registrations since 2013.   and  BMW AG  led gains, with the latter joining the former in laying out   about its EV ambitions. Investors’ willingness to overlook last month’s 20% plunge in European auto sales reinforces just how fixated the capital markets are now on the transition to EVs. VW Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Diess  has capitalized on the shift,   a rapid-fire messaging strategy similar to  ’s  Elon Musk .  Daimler AG  also is taking the   of splitting up its car and truck operations to better position for the new era. “Volkswagen and Daimler are leading the charge for tech recognition that we see reducing the valuation gap with Tesla,”  Michael Dean , a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, wrote in a  . “Against a weak start to 2021 for European auto sales, hopes of a V-shaped demand recovery are fueling earnings optimism.” Registrations plunged to 850,170 vehicles last month, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association   Wednesday. Spain led declines among major markets with a 38% fall, while the U.K. shrunk 36%. Shuttered showrooms, slow vaccination and economic damage caused by the virus call into question the high expectations for earnings recovery, BI’s Dean   earlier this week. France’s   is the   because of its high exposure to the region. Projecting demand in Europe will remain difficult even as year-over-year comparisons get easier in the coming months, BI analyst  Gillian Davis  said in an earlier  . The initial pandemic-related sales shock began in March of last year. Among the continent’s biggest automakers, deliveries for Renault fell the most at 29%, followed by   at 22%.

Hong Kong Explores Easing Measures for Vaccinated as Bookings Jump," Hong Kong saw more than 144,000 people snap up Covid-19 vaccine appointments the first day the government   access to a majority of residents, a sharp increase amid its bid to boost a lackluster inoculation rollout. Some 30,800 people reserved slots to get the Chinese-made   shot and 113,200 others booked doses of  ’s vaccine at community vaccine centers in the 24 hours ending at 8 p.m. Tuesday, the government  . The number of bookings soared from just 18,600 the day earlier. Data was not available from private clinics, some of which are also offering Sinovac’s shot. Before the expansion, only some 200,000 people -- comprising just 5.4% of priority groups eligible like the elderly and   workers -- had come forward for shots since the vaccine drive started on Feb. 26. The total number of people able to access vaccines now represents some 70% of the city’s population of 7.5 million, with adults  30 to 59 years old now eligible. The government added 23,000 new reservation slots to daily capacity on Tuesday, and has increased the number of community centers offering the BioNTech shot from seven to 19. The extended drive comes as the city grapples with a new outbreak of the virus centered on its expatriate community, including employees of international financial firms.  ’s main Hong Kong office was ordered to close until further notice after three people working in the building tested positive for Covid-19. Chief Executive  Carrie Lam  said at a Wednesday Legislative Council meeting that the government would   whether there was room for virus-related social distancing measures to be relaxed for people who were vaccinated. She added that authorities had held preliminary talks with China regarding the easing of some travel restrictions for individuals who had received two vaccine doses. While Hong Kong’s healthy adult population is one of the first in the world to gain eligibility for inoculation, the expanded access reflects a major vaccine hesitation problem that will likely delay the city’s ability to reopen to the world. Officials widened eligibility earlier than expected after uptake was dismal among priority groups, leaving millions of doses unused. Demand for Covid-19 vaccines has generally been lower in Asia, where contained outbreaks and low death tolls in places like Japan and Singapore has meant that people   less urgency and more skepticism toward rapidly-developed shots. It’s unclear if the younger adult population will ultimately help boost these underwhelming numbers, after the initial burst of pent-up demand. An informal poll of 13 people in the 30 to 59 years old group on Tuesday showed that half were planning to get a vaccine now that they can. George Lin, chief financial officer at  . and a former banker at  , said he was so excited to book a slot that he had a sleepless night. He signed up early Tuesday morning and will receive his first dose of BioNTech’s shot on Saturday in Causeway Bay. “The first thing I would like to do is to travel internationally,” Lin said, including to the U.S to see his two daughters. “If I were in the U.S., I would not get this until May.” Others said they did not want to take the risk.   among Hong Kong residents has grown after reports of several deaths among inoculated people, though experts said none of them are directly tied to the vaccine. “I don’t trust the vaccines, there’s not enough data to show it is safe, there’s not been enough testing,” said hairstylist Kei Ma, 41. “I don’t know how many other things the government is hiding.” Political turmoil and China’s tightening grip over the former British colony are complicating factors as city officials try to persuade people to take the vaccine. Lam received Sinovac’s shot on Feb. 22 along with other cabinet members. “The absence of trust only complicates the vaccine rollout,” said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor in health security at City University of Hong Kong. “Short of mandatory vaccinations, which would likely be resisted by the population, the Hong Kong government is facing a slower path to reopening than its earlier successes against the virus suggested would be the case.” China is   to ease requirements for foreigners applying for mainland visas from Hong Kong if they’ve received a Chinese vaccine, something that reassures  David Bonnet , managing partner at real estate and hospitality advisory firm Delta State Holdings Ltd. who signed up for a Sinovac shot. “If you live in Hong Kong and Macau, getting one of the Chinese vaccines probably will give some tangible benefits,” he said. “I don’t want to be subject to quarantines and I   it will be easier to travel with Chinese vaccines. My   is to resume business as normal.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/hong-kong-vaccine-bookings-jump-in-first-day-of-expanded-access,"[{'id': '20782465', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.7696451792680661, 'directScore': 0.7696451792680661}, {'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 12.846347617642154, 'directScore': 0.5080809957272896}, {'id': '0855349D:HK', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.1606910644621958, 'directScore': 0.1606910644621958}, {'id': 'BAC:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.4081367267323054, 'directScore': 0.4081367267323054}, {'id': '2552:HK', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.41575329741779676, 'directScore': 0.41575329741779676}, {'id': 'PFE:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.9368381943154375, 'directScore': 0.9368381943154375}, {'id': 'HSBA:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 1.4486345903771132, 'directScore': 1.4486345903771132}, {'id': 'SVA:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 1.6152702953743265, 'directScore': 1.6152702953743265}, {'id': 'SG', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.4939624744566227, 'directScore': 0.4939624744566227}, {'id': 'JP', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.4958201746238157, 'directScore': 0.4958201746238157}, {'id': 'CN', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.8547278469255062, 'directScore': 0.8547278469255062}, {'id': 'HK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 12.796946268183204, 'directScore': 12.790451421140627}, {'id': 'real-estate', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.06836336615270296, 'directScore': 0.06836336615270296}, {'id': 'travel', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.969162177224596, 'directScore': 0.969162177224596}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.3139513282556194, 'directScore': 2.3139513282556194}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.932862211604657, 'directScore': 4.932862211604657}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.4339814549406835, 'directScore': 5.4339814549406835}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 3.8729974343093287, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'GB', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.4486345903771132, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 1.4486345903771132, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'industrials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.8984278184137078, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 5.230465077497668, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8547278469255062, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.06836336615270296, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 1.895247823505024, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'brics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8547278469255062, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'science', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.1606910644621958, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.895247823505024, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'UK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.4486345903771132, 'directScore': 0}]"
Australia Urges Europe to Send AstraZeneca Vaccines to PNG," Australia is urging the European Union to divert 1 million doses of the   vaccine that it’s already contracted to near-neighbor Papua New Guinea, as a wave of coronavirus infections rocks the Pacific region’s most-populous nation. The formal request to AstraZeneca and European authorities comes just weeks after Italy   a shipment of 250,700 doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine to Australia, using a recently introduced EU regulation for the first time. “I expect and would   to get cooperation out of Europe for this,” Australian Prime Minister  Scott Morrison  told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday. “This is not Australia seeking to do this for our own direct benefit, although we’ve contracted them and you would expect them to be supplied.” In the meantime, Australia will send 8,000 vaccine doses from domestic stocks to aid frontline health workers in the country of 9 million people, along with 1 million surgical masks and other medical equipment. Cases of the virus in PNG almost doubled each week in February. While the World Health Organization said that 96 new cases had been detected in the country on Monday from the previous 24 hours, authorities believe the vast majority of cases aren’t being detected due to the nation’s substandard health facilities. There are growing fears the virus may spread eastwards from PNG to other Pacific Islands nations, which could have geopolitical implications as China seeks to enhance its influence. While Beijing is believed to have been offering its vaccine in the region, Australia has agreed with its   -- including key ally the U.S. -- to ramp up efforts to increase access to Western vaccines in the Indo-Pacific. “This is a very welcome announcement from the government,” said Jonathan Pryke, who heads research on the Pacific region for the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think tank. “PNG’s health system is on the brink of collapse. The need is immediate and urgent. But vaccines for health workers is not a panacea. PNG has a very tough few months ahead.” PNG Prime Minister  James Marape  is expected to announce a national strategy to contain the outbreak on Wednesday, including measures to stop widespread movement, the Post Courier reported. He said he was concerned that the health system wasn’t adequate to cope with a full-blown outbreak. Morrison said the EU deploying AstraZeneca vaccines directly to PNG would “be following through on the very public statements that have been made in the European Union about their commitment to ensure there is no vaccine protectionism and that vaccines do go to those most in need.” The COVAX facility has indicated it will deliver 588,000 vaccines for PNG by June, Morrison said. Morrison also announced strict travel restrictions between the nations, with some PNG islands just kilometers away from Australian territory. “The events we’re seeing there are of great concern,” Morrison said. “The escalation of issues with the virus in PNG presents very real risks to Australia as well.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/australia-urges-europe-to-send-astrazeneca-vaccines-to-png,"[{'id': 'beijing', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.48746429704855604, 'directScore': 0.48746429704855604}, {'id': '21075891', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.2995874325610917, 'directScore': 0.2995874325610917}, {'id': '3977809', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.7194541415423675, 'directScore': 0.7194541415423675}, {'id': '0751538D:SW', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.6223421136147255, 'directScore': 0.6223421136147255}, {'id': 'AZN:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 9.488328524302325, 'directScore': 9.488328524302325}, {'id': 'travel', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.0853697238971755, 'directScore': 0.0853697238971755}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9505797888097114, 'directScore': 0.3989209774674706}, {'id': 'stocks', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6896223421136147, 'directScore': 0.6896223421136147}, {'id': 'regulation', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8578229133608378, 'directScore': 0.8578229133608378}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.4290662184452514, 'directScore': 3.4290662184452514}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 11.93488029289403, 'directScore': 9.893769254869726}, {'id': 'CN', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.5014281180577594, 'directScore': 0.5014281180577594}, {'id': 'IT', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.8968581402729292, 'directScore': 0.8968581402729292}, {'id': 'PG', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 2.2018485215353936, 'directScore': 2.2018485215353936}, {'id': 'AU', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 11.824182799111394, 'directScore': 11.824182799111394}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.6896223421136147, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'GB', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 9.488328524302325, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'industrials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 9.488328524302325, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 10.107957951148453, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5014281180577594, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 11.978690402603435, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'brics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5014281180577594, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'science', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'CH', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.6223421136147255, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'megacity', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.48746429704855604, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6223421136147255, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'UK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 9.488328524302325, 'directScore': 0}]"
EU Revives U.K. Vaccine Export Fight Over Missing Supplies," European Commission President  Ursula von der Leyen  threatened to withhold vaccine exports to the U.K., reopening a dispute with the British government that has dramatically increased tensions between the EU and its former member. As the European Union struggles to quicken the pace of its stuttering Covid vaccination program, von der Leyen raised the prospect of pulling an emergency trigger in the bloc’s treaty -- used previously only during the oil crisis of the 1970s -- to allow authorities to effectively seize control of production and distribution. She said the EU will consider blocking supplies to countries that aren’t reciprocating or which already have high vaccination rates, singling out the U.K. as the No. 1 importer of shots. “All options are on the table, we are in the crisis of the century,” von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday. “I am not ruling out anything for now because we have to make sure that Europeans are vaccinated as soon as possible.” The threat comes as the bloc’s vaccine rollout is in a state of chaos. A number of countries suspended the use of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine to examine side effects even though the EU’s drugs regulator has repeatedly said the benefits of the shot outweigh risks. The World Health Organization reiterated its view that the vaccine should continue to be administered ahead of a highly anticipated review from the European Medicines Agency on Thursday. France has said it would follow the EMA’s advice. As Britain’s vaccination campaign continues to outstrip Europe’s, with almost four times the rate of doses administered, Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  said he’s getting his coronavirus vaccination “very shortly” -- and it “will certainly be Oxford-AstraZeneca I’ll be having.” The U.K. has insisted the Astra shot is safe and effective and urged the public to take it. Earlier, U.K. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told LBC Radio that comments from some politicians in Europe about the safety of the vaccine were “very, very unhelpful.” The EU has now administered 11 doses per 100 people, compared to 33 doses in the U.S. and 39 doses in the U.K., according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Despite the delays, the bloc boosted the number of doses it expects to get in the second quarter to 360 million.  The EU hinted at banning exports to the U.K. in January but that prospect faded after von der Leyen suggested she had received assurances from Johnson that Astra supplies to Europe wouldn’t be restricted.  “We have observed that in the last six weeks, 10 million doses have been exported to the U.K.,” she said. “If the situation doesn’t change, we will have to reflect on how to make exports to vaccine-producing countries dependent on their level of openness.” Von der Leyen said that EU leaders should consider additional measures to secure vaccine supplies when they meet next week, including the potential use of emergency legal powers to effectively seize control of production and distribution. Article 122 of the EU treaty allows the introduction of emergency measures when “severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products.” European Council President  Charles Michel  had touted the possibility of invoking Article 122 in January. An official familiar with the matter said then that the measures could help to get the bloc’s vaccination program back on track. “Vaccine production and vaccine deliveries in the EU must have a priority and I also want to discuss this whole picture with the heads of state and government,” von der Leyen said.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/eu-touts-use-of-emergency-powers-to-seize-vaccine-production,"[{'id': 'radio', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.44129554655870445, 'directScore': 0.44129554655870445}, {'id': '2432301', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.8148448043184885, 'directScore': 0.8148448043184885}, {'id': '0751538D:SW', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.6164642375168691, 'directScore': 0.6164642375168691}, {'id': 'AZN:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 1.4798920377867746, 'directScore': 1.4798920377867746}, {'id': '7535532Z:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 2.407557354925776, 'directScore': 2.407557354925776}, {'id': 'CL1:COM', 'type': 'Commodity', 'derivedScore': 0.8545209176788124, 'directScore': 0.8545209176788124}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5079622132253712, 'directScore': 0.5079622132253712}, {'id': 'drugs', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6380566801619433, 'directScore': 0.6380566801619433}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 2.1416329284750337}, {'id': 'exports', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.461673414304993, 'directScore': 3.461673414304993}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 5.966455235915582, 'directScore': 5.367611336032389}, {'id': 'FR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.5670715249662618, 'directScore': 0.5670715249662618}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.8545209176788124, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'GB', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 2.8623918864944353, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'energy', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.8545209176788124, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'industrials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.4798920377867746, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.5670692113496187, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'science', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'CH', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.6164642375168691, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'materials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.407557354925776, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'futures-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8545209176788124, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6164642375168691, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'commodity-futures', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8545209176788124, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'global-trade', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.461673414304993, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'UK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 2.8623918864944353, 'directScore': 0}]"
"SocGen, Credit Suisse Profit as Trading Boom Endures Into 2021"," Europe’s top investment banks are still profiting from a boom in trading and advisory work well into the first quarter, signaling there’s no end in sight yet to the gains that drove profits last year.  is seeing its best start to a year in a decade, and   as well as   have flagged strong investment banking results. While the tone is optimistic across the board, banks that did well during the onset of the pandemic a year ago are cautioning it will be difficult to top those high trading volumes. The firms are enjoying a spike in transactions as central banks pump money into the economy, investors buy and sell securities while companies and governments issue bonds to weather the fallout from lockdowns. That’s a stark contrast with traditional banking businesses, which are preparing for a surge in defaults and more relentless headwinds from negative interest rates. “We had an excellent start to the year,” Credit Suisse Chief Executive Officer  Thomas Gottstein  told a conference organized by Morgan Stanley on Tuesday. “It’s a broad-based strength in investment banking, capital markets in particular.” Credit Suisse saw revenue at its investment bank jump more than 50% in the first two months and pretax income for the group rise to the highest in 10 years. But the good news was overshadowed as the bank warned it may take a financial hit related to the implosion of  Greensill Capital , which forced it to freeze $10 billion of funds and put a loan to the firm at risk. Deutsche Bank, which flagged a “strong start” to the year in its annual report last week, is scheduled to present at the conference on Thursday. Investors will probably be focused on the outlook for revenue after the German lender said the investment bank probably won’t reach the high volumes of last year and cited an uncertain economic environment. That slightly more cautious tone echoes comments by the biggest Wall Street banks.   Chief Financial Officer  Jennifer Piepszak  said her bank has generated more trading revenue this year than in the same period of 2020, but didn’t want to make predictions for the first quarter because “we’re heading into a much more challenging” comparison to year-earlier figures for March.  expects revenue from trading stocks and fixed-income products will drop by a percentage in the mid-single digits in the first quarter. Investment banking revenue, however, will probably rise in the high teens or low twenties, helped by a strong business of underwriting initial public offerings, according to CFO Mark Mason. Both Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse have benefited from a surge in so-called special purpose acquisition vehicles that has boosted income from advising on initial public offerings. Deutsche Bank, which cut back its equities team in 2019, now ranks 10th globally among advisers on IPOs while Credit Suisse climbed to third position. For the French banks, which were hit hard last year when dividend cancellations caused steep losses on complex derivatives, the continued trading boom offers a chance to restore investor confidence.   anticipates a moderate revenue growth in 2021 and a decline in provisions for bad loans to more normal figures, as lockdowns ease and widescale vaccination programs take hold. SocGen has finished restructuring its equities division and is seeing a good start to the year,  William Kadouch-Chassaing , the bank’s head of finance, told the Morgan Stanley conference Tuesday. The lender posted its first annual loss in more than three decades last year, and has announced hundreds of job cuts in the investment bank. “So far year to date, things hold well, we have a good start of the year, in some areas I would say even a strong start of the year compared with last year,” Kadouch-Chassaing said.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/socgen-credit-suisse-profit-as-trading-boom-endures-into-2021,"[{'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 10.154589500933184, 'directScore': 4}, {'id': '15824518', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.11411332633788038, 'directScore': 0.11411332633788038}, {'id': '16365577', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.32292759706190977, 'directScore': 0.32292759706190977}, {'id': '19013293', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.4769150052465897, 'directScore': 0.4769150052465897}, {'id': '4974949', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.7381951731374606, 'directScore': 0.7381951731374606}, {'id': 'ipos', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.24685204616998951, 'directScore': 0.24685204616998951}, {'id': 'stocks', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.39637985309548796, 'directScore': 0.39637985309548796}, {'id': 'wall-street', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.49370409233997903, 'directScore': 0.49370409233997903}, {'id': 'environment', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5136411332633788, 'directScore': 0.5136411332633788}, {'id': 'interest-rates', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7623294858342078, 'directScore': 0.7623294858342078}, {'id': 'bonds', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8129590766002098, 'directScore': 0.8129590766002098}, {'id': 'capital-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.3302728226652676, 'directScore': 1.3302728226652676}, {'id': 'investment-banking', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 7.859109292527696, 'directScore': 7.859109292527696}, {'id': 'BNP:FP', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.181794333683106, 'directScore': 0.181794333683106}, {'id': 'C:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.40792235047219305, 'directScore': 0.40792235047219305}, {'id': 'JPM:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.48871983210912906, 'directScore': 0.48871983210912906}, {'id': 'MS:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.8174186778593914, 'directScore': 0.8174186778593914}, {'id': 'DBK:GR', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 2.12093389296957, 'directScore': 2.12093389296957}, {'id': 'GLE:FP', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 6.054039874081846, 'directScore': 6.054039874081846}, {'id': 'CSGN:SW', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 7.664321469733198, 'directScore': 7.664321469733198}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.170385582865813, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 10.396106409683856, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.170385582865813, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'CH', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 7.664321469733198, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7623294858342078, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'monetary-policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7623294858342078, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'banking', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 7.859109292527696, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7623294858342078, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'FR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 6.056769388624753, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.0633046679157905, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 1.0633046679157905, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'DE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 2.12093389296957, 'directScore': 0}]"
"Biden Agrees Putin Is Killer, Says He’ll Pay Price for Meddling"," President  Joe Biden  agreed that Russian President  Vladimir Putin  is a “killer,” and said in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday that Russia would pay for alleged interference in U.S. elections. His comments, recorded Tuesday, came the same day as a U.S. intelligence community report that Putin ordered influence operations to hurt Biden’s candidacy, favoring former President  Donald Trump  just as the intelligence community says the Russian leader did in 2016 against then-Democratic presidential candidate  Hillary Clinton . Putin “will pay a price” for the interference, Biden said. In a “long talk” with the Russian leader, Biden said he told him, “I know you and you know me. If I establish this occurred, then be prepared.” After ABC News Chief Anchor  George Stephanopoulos  asked Biden if he believes Putin is “a killer,” Biden murmured agreement and said “I do,” without elaborating. Russia’s ruble sank as much as 1.6% to 74 per dollar, its biggest intraday loss since Feb. 25. The benchmark MOEX index also extended declines, and was down 2.1% as of 2:37 p.m. in Moscow. Ten-year bond yields were up three basis points at 6.84%, near their highest in a year. Vyacheslav Volodin , the speaker of the lower house of Russia’s parliament and a longtime Putin ally, dismissed Biden’s comments as “hysterics born of helplessness,” saying they “insult the citizens of our country.” Many officials in Putin’s government and associates of the Russian leader already live under U.S. sanctions due to previous rounds of punishment for election interference, attacks on political opponents and Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, leaving unclear what Biden may target. CNN reported that the U.S. may sanction more Putin associates. Biden said that in a past conversation with Putin, he told him that he “looked in your eyes and I don’t think you have a soul.” The remark was a reference to George W. Bush’s 2001 assessment of Putin, when the former U.S. president said that “I looked the man in the eye” and “was able to get a sense of his soul.” In December, then-Director of National Intelligence and Trump ally  John Ratcliffe  held up completion of Tuesday’s report, saying it needed to more fully reflect the national security threat posed by China, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of the information. But in the end the report indicated that China did not “deploy interference efforts” in an effort to change the election outcome. Earlier Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  denounced the U.S. intelligence report as “absolutely groundless.” “It’s regrettable that the beginning of each presidential term in the U.S. seems to be linked to imposing sanctions on Russia,” he said. Putin has vociferously denied allegations his government is behind attacks on opponents. While the Kremlin has said it hopes for improved relations under the Biden administration, officials have few illusions that ties will get much better.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/biden-agrees-putin-is-killer-says-he-ll-pay-price-for-meddling,"[{'id': 'moscow', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.6200569440050617, 'directScore': 0.6200569440050617}, {'id': 'USD:CUR', 'type': 'Currency', 'derivedScore': 0.6618158810503005, 'directScore': 0.6618158810503005}, {'id': '17163546', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.5906358747231889, 'directScore': 0.5906358747231889}, {'id': '1442508', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.8402404302435938, 'directScore': 0.8402404302435938}, {'id': '1252249', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 1.1622904144258146, 'directScore': 1.1622904144258146}, {'id': '1920085', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 12.867431834419467, 'directScore': 12.867431834419467}, {'id': '13387985', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 14.464152346412627, 'directScore': 14.464152346412627}, {'id': 'national-security', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5352736475798798, 'directScore': 0.5352736475798798}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8668146453944651, 'directScore': 0.5776652957924708}, {'id': 'economic-sanctions', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5782980069598229, 'directScore': 0.5782980069598229}, {'id': 'bonds', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6146788990825688, 'directScore': 0.6146788990825688}, {'id': 'elections', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.7810232309363148, 'directScore': 1.7810232309363148}, {'id': 'CN', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.41695665928503634, 'directScore': 0.41695665928503634}, {'id': 'UA', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.44859221765264157, 'directScore': 0.44859221765264157}, {'id': 'RU', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 4.375794558031681, 'directScore': 4.375794558031681}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.9472654749598204, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.6146788990825688, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'u-s-presidential-election-2020', 'type': 'Event', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'politics', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.3061566034190857, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 4.398788665166939, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'economics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5782980069598229, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.418596776487812, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.41695665928503634, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.6618158810503005, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'brics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.395659848028333, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6146788990825688, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'megacity', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6200569440050617, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'currency', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6618158810503005, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.6618158810503005, 'directScore': 0}]"
NRG Energy Sees $750 Million Loss Following Texas Cold Snap,"  withdrew an earlier full-year profit forecast and said it expects a $750 million loss due to the brutal cold snap that froze Texas and led to sweeping blackouts across the state. “Based on the new information available to us today, we are unable to provide financial guidance due to the unprecedented and unpredictable market outcomes resulting from winter storm Uri,” Chief Executive Officer  Mauricio Gutierrez  said Wednesday in a  .

"Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank Face Collateral Damage From Greensill"," The insolvency of Greensill Bank may cost Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG dearly over the next few years. Germany’s two biggest lenders face having to make the largest payments to replenish Germany’s deposit-insurance funds as a result of compensation to depositors after the winding down of Greensill Bank, Commerzbank Chief Executive Officer  Manfred Knof  said at a conference late Tuesday. Along with UniCredit SpA’s German unit HVB, the two are the largest contributors to the funds, he said. The German financial watchdog BaFin said on Tuesday that the deposit-insurance funds must compensate depositors of the Bremen-based Greensill Bank after the parent company, owned by financier  Lex Greensill , collapsed earlier this month. The need to refill the insurance funds widens the collateral damage from the unraveling of the trade finance company to institutions like Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank who say they had no direct exposure to Greensill. Spokesmen for Deutsche Bank and HVB declined to comment. Deutsche Bank flagged higher contributions to deposit insurance funds as a key risk in its annual report published last week. The specter of rising contributions to deposit insurance comes on top of potentially higher fees to be paid to Europe’s bank resolution fund. Deutsche Bank has assumed   to that pot in the cost forecast it delivered in December last year. Greensill Bank has about 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) of insured deposits, about a third of which will be covered by a compulsory insurance fund while a voluntary fund will cover the other two thirds, a person familiar with the matter has said. The compulsory fund had 3 billion euros in it at the end of 2019, according to data from the European Banking Authority, meaning the Greensill Bank payout will eliminate about a third. How much contributions rise also depends on what the funds can rescue from Greensill Bank, with historic recovery rates usually ranging above 50%, a person familiar has said. However, the voluntary fund expects to recover less than that in this case and the amount also depends on how much the trade insurer Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. will agree to cover, a person familiar with the matter has said. In any case, the funds aren’t likely to get money back from Greensill Bank any time soon. The insolvency proceedings could last  , the administrator, Michael Frege, said in an interview with the German weekly WirtschaftsWoche on Tuesday.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/deutsche-bank-commerzbank-face-collateral-damage-from-greensill,"[{'id': '7520936', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.8634569850039463, 'directScore': 0.8634569850039463}, {'id': '21052685', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 10.540893391164564, 'directScore': 10.540893391164564}, {'id': '8766:JP', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.13220205209155486, 'directScore': 0.13220205209155486}, {'id': '0561898D:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.2876874506708761, 'directScore': 0.2876874506708761}, {'id': 'UCG:IM', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.84017363851618, 'directScore': 0.84017363851618}, {'id': 'CBK:GR', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 8.213656554246548, 'directScore': 8.213656554246548}, {'id': 'DBK:GR', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 10.126988552022766, 'directScore': 10.126988552022766}, {'id': 'bank-deposits', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.0126282557221784, 'directScore': 1.0126282557221784}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 11.480146470242373, 'directScore': 0.48382004735595896}, {'id': 'DE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 12.642506202489594, 'directScore': 1.8808208366219414}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 11.21283448529051, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'GB', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.2876874506708761, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'banking', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.0126282557221784, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'JP', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.13220205209155486, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.13220205209155486, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'IT', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.84017363851618, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'UK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.2876874506708761, 'directScore': 0}]"
Oil Set for Longest Run of Losses in Six Months as Rally Wavers," Oil  headed for its longest run on declines in over six months after the International Energy Agency said talk of an upcoming supply shortfall could be  . Futures in New York declined 0.9%. OPEC and its partners could quickly deploy their stalled production spare capacity to quash oil price rallies, the IEA said in its monthly report.

Traders will get more supply information Wednesday with the U.S. inventory data, which could show the first  in crude stockpiles since mid-February. The Federal Reserve   is also due later, as attention on the pace of global inflation grows. Oil’s rally this year, spurred by OPEC+ output cuts and Covid-19 vaccines, is wavering as the rebound in demand continues to be patchy. Consumption is   in some regions including the U.S., although parts of Europe are   and the outlook for the continent’s biggest economy has been  .

The IEA report “triggered oil prices to enter into  ,” Kevin Solomon, an analyst at StoneX Group said. “Price action in the oil complex has been relatively directionless as broader markets are cautious on the Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting later today.” Attention is sharpening on the U.S. supply picture after the recent Texas freeze caused a serious of gyrations in the market. Earlier this week profit from making  gasoline  neared $25 a barrel following some of the biggest inventory draws on record. That’s pulled European supply to help fill the gap. At the same time, U.S. crude inventories have been growing in recent weeks. It’s forced the  prompt timespread  for WTI into contango, a bearish market structure.

"Yields Jump, Tech Declines Amid Dot Plot Anxiety: Markets Wrap"," Treasury yields climbed to more than one-year highs and growth stocks favored under the so-called reflation trade fell amid concern Federal Reserve officials could revise forecasts for when they see a liftoff from near-zero rates. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 slumped for the first time in three trading sessions as U.S. central bankers meet for a second day. The S&P 500 also declined, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher amid a rotation back to value stocks such as Boeing Co. Fuel-cell firm Plug Power Inc. tumbled after it   accounting errors. “The interest rate game continues to be the key catalyst among movement within the U.S. equity market. The 10-year Treasury yield rises, the Nasdaq 100 falls and partially drags the S&P 500 with it,”said  Michael O’Rourke , chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “The Federal Reserve certainly does not need to react to every signal the market provides. The market just wants the chairman to indicate that he is not blind to it.” Expectations of a strong recovery from the Covid-19 slump are putting an intense focus on Fed officials’ projections for interest rates displayed in their “dot plot.” Two-thirds of economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect policy makers to continue to signal no liftoff from near-zero rates through 2023, though more of the 18 central bankers could drift their dots higher. The yield on 30-year Treasuries spiked to a level unseen since 2019 and the 10-year hit 1.67%. Market-implied  inflation  expectations are at 12-year highs. The dollar strengthened versus most major peers. “So what happens with the fixed income markets will ultimately determine also what happens with equity markets too, especially if those fixed income yields start to rise,” said  Rohan Reddy , a research analyst at Global   Management. “So I would expect them to come out with a slightly more detailed policy, and if they don’t you could see a bit of a market selloff.” Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell, and South Korean stocks retreated as   warned it’s grappling with the fallout from a “serious imbalance” in semiconductors globally. WTI crude oil reversed a gain after the International Energy Agency   markets aren’t on the verge of a new price supercycle. Bitcoin held at about $55,000, below the weekend record above $61,000.

High-Flying Platinum Stocks Set to Extend Johannesburg Gains," The blistering pace of gains that has pushed South African platinum stocks to the highest in more than 12 years looks likely to be sustained as an upswing in demand and supply constraints fuel the rally. Johannesburg’s index of platinum stocks has soared 30% this year, leaving the other sectors in the local equities benchmark trailing in their wake. Over 12 months, the FTSE/JSE Africa Platinum Mining Index is up an eye-watering 230% as of Tuesday’s close, thanks to surging prices for palladium and rhodium, dug up with platinum and used in vehicle pollution-control devices.  at No. 1 global palladium miner MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC have added to worries over production of platinum group metals. Last year, the platinum market experienced its biggest annual supply deficit on record. Palladium   since January on Tuesday after   said it will take at least three to four months to fully reopen two Arctic mines affected by flooding. “Given the Norilsk situation, I think PGM prices could rise further near-term,”  David Aserkoff , a London-based JPMorgan Chase & Co. equity strategist, said in emailed comments. JPMorgan has an overweight recommendation on the South African platinum sector, with Sibanye Stillwater Ltd. among its top 10 picks for Central and eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, while Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. is among the leading selections in South Africa. Estimated dividend yields on the platinum index have surged as earnings expectations are ratcheted higher, jumping to 11.5% from 4.3% at the end of 2020. “Earnings expectations have increased quite significantly for 2021 due to the higher basket price,” said  Seleho Tsatsi , an investment analyst at Anchor Capital in Johannesburg. Analysts have also revised their 12-month earnings-per-share projections by 100% since April, as climbing metals prices drive increased profits in the sector. Royal Bafokeng Platinum Ltd. has gained the most among its peers this year, soaring 75% as of Tuesday’s close. Anglo American Platinum Ltd. is up 44% and Impala Platinum up 38%. Northam Platinum Ltd. has gained 19% and Sibanye 17%. Investors may continue to be drawn to the sector by the supply constraints and other indicators that suggests the stocks remain inexpensively valued, despite their spectacular ascent. The index’s 12-month forward price-earnings ratio is at 5.85 times, below its three year average of 12.66 times. The price to book ratio is at 0.98 times, below the three year average of 2.06. The index slumped 3.4% as of 2:38 p.m. on Wednesday, declining for the fourth session out of five. “I would be surprised if any pullback lasted longer than a month or two,” JPMorgan’s Aserkoff said, citing supportive longer-term factors such as energy transitions, the low valuation multiples and the sector’s role as offering investors protection against weakening in the rand. “Moreover, given that the majority of global PGM production is in South Africa, any local issues, typically power or labor, will also push global PGM prices higher, a nice hedge.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/platinum-s-high-flying-stocks-set-to-extend-johannesburg-gains,"[{'id': 'Middleeast', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.570957095709571, 'directScore': 0.570957095709571}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 2.2689515048075206, 'directScore': 0.5732673267326732}, {'id': 'Africa', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 2.1123812444216714, 'directScore': 1.4412541254125413}, {'id': 'johannesburg', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 4.616336633663366, 'directScore': 4.616336633663366}, {'id': 'labor', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.019471947194719473, 'directScore': 0.019471947194719473}, {'id': 'valuation', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.09174917491749175, 'directScore': 0.09174917491749175}, {'id': 'earnings', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.0006600660066007, 'directScore': 1.0006600660066007}, {'id': 'stocks', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 8.28476036027248, 'directScore': 8.28476036027248}, {'id': 'NHM:SJ', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.3198019801980198, 'directScore': 0.3198019801980198}, {'id': 'AMS:SJ', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.3415841584158416, 'directScore': 0.3415841584158416}, {'id': 'RBP:SJ', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.37755775577557754, 'directScore': 0.37755775577557754}, {'id': 'IMP:SJ', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.8891089108910892, 'directScore': 0.8891089108910892}, {'id': 'SSW:SJ', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.9033003300330034, 'directScore': 0.9033003300330034}, {'id': 'JPM:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 1.3943894389438944, 'directScore': 1.3943894389438944}, {'id': 'GMKN:RM', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 2.1940594059405942, 'directScore': 2.1940594059405942}, {'id': 'ZA', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.5972184861891376, 'directScore': 0.5755775577557756}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 2.872288546544185, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 8.402103640155492, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.634915622654323, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.559435136203151, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 1.3943894389438944, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'brics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.634915622654323, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'materials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.559435136203151, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'metals-mining', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.559435136203151, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'RU', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 2.1940594059405942, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.3943894389438944, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'technology', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 2.559435136203151, 'directScore': 0}]"
MBAs Wander Minecraft-Like Campus for Covid-Era Networking," When Grégoire Gloriod joined the master’s program at Neoma, a business school with sites in three French cities, he enjoyed the academics but found himself savoring the social aspect of campus life even more. He attended lectures and mixers, met people from around the world, and did his share of partying. Then Covid-19 hit, and suddenly all that was left were the marketing, accounting, and other classes on his computer screen. “The biggest miss is the moment between classes,” says Gloriod, who graduates in 2023. “That’s the point where you can meet classmates, drink coffee, and talk about life.” A key selling point of business schools is their ability to bring together students of various nationalities and backgrounds, who forge friendships in the hallways and lounges that pay dividends decades later. “The network is a close second, if not as important as the academic experience,” says Minya Nance, assistant dean for student experience strategy at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. But in an era of online learning, MBA students are struggling to make such connections—spurring schools around the world to develop new avenues to those crucial relationships via virtual campuses, Slack channels, and Zoom roadshows. Neoma has created a  -like world with 80 virtual rooms, lecture halls, and workspaces where students—or, rather, their avatars—can wander and engage in casual conversations, cooperate on projects, and debate the issues of the day. The polygonal representation of the campus, hosting activities such as language courses, concerts, and case-study contests, is redecorated regularly for Christmas, the Lunar New Year, and other seasonal events. The idea is to offer a break from the routine of back-to-back videoconferences, says Alain Goudey, Neoma’s chief digital officer, whose blocky avatar—decked out in a form-fitting black suit and with better-kempt hair than the real human—frequently ambles through the virtual world. “We provide the context for people to be together at the same time, in the same place, and do what happens on the real campus,” he says. At Kellogg, students have taken matters into their own hands. Finding the Zoom-class experience lacking, Marilyn Caton, a member of the class of 2021, created DIY Kellogg, an informal Slack channel where students can chat about life outside the classroom. The channel has been used for everything from networking groups to trivia nights and cutest pet competitions. Several times last year, students took to Slack to play a weeklong mafia game in which they secretly colluded to decided whom to “kill off” each night until only one was left standing. Kellogg students also teamed up with 10 other schools for a virtual game show that raised $55,000 for Doctors Without Borders. “We all place a premium on in-person experiences, and thinking about doing it virtually was tough to wrap our minds around,” Caton says. Students at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business have organized online games of Jeopardy! to create a sense of cohesion. And though annual fixtures such as the Darden Follies and Spring Soirees were canceled, the Darden Cup—a sporting competition among the school’s five sections—took place through the Strava fitness app. Students and staff logged a combined 10,496 miles of biking, running, hiking, and even playing rounds of golf. The events “take your mind off the many stressors of the MBA program by giving you a chance to have fun with your classmates,” says Nick Talbott, a Darden student who set up the Jeopardy! games. Harvard Business School professors have started making time after online classes to chat informally with students or respond to their questions about assignments. But for Rashveena Rajaram, a member of the class of 2022, those sessions fell flat compared with the interactions she’d been expecting. So she and her friends created a virtual version of the school’s annual visit to venture capital companies on the West Coast, during which students can connect with tech companies and VC firms. In January, Rajaram and her peers organized a series of online meetings with Silicon Valley stalwarts such as Sequoia Capital and Accel, but they also included funds from Europe and Asia—something the pre-Covid physical trek didn’t offer. “I wouldn’t be surprised if some components of the virtual trips stay,” Rajaram says, “especially when it comes to being able to expand our footprint.” Harvard MBA candidate Grace An organized a smaller health-care-club trek in March, inviting employers to meet with current MBAs. The member of the class of 2022 says she appreciated the chance to engage in candid conversations with people from the companies and get insights into their aims for hiring, but she’ll have no regrets about a return to pre-pandemic life. Sure, online forums can help with contacts, and participants often get together for informal Zoom calls to shoot the breeze in much the same way they might offline. But she’s tired of relationships that rarely progress beyond texting, chatrooms, and video meetings. Far more important “is the bonding and the dinners afterward,” she says. “Just giving someone a hug.”  ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/how-business-school-students-network-during-covid-virtual-hangouts,"[{'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.18597560975609756, 'directScore': 0.18597560975609756}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.18807164634146342, 'directScore': 0.18807164634146342}, {'id': '1758014D:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.6785442073170732, 'directScore': 0.6785442073170732}, {'id': '0358961Z:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 11.320999630450851, 'directScore': 11.320999630450851}, {'id': 'virginia', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.4291158536585366, 'directScore': 0.4291158536585366}, {'id': 'golf', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.3508003048780488, 'directScore': 0.3508003048780488}, {'id': 'venture-capital', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.43959603658536583, 'directScore': 0.43959603658536583}, {'id': 'christmas', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6812118902439024, 'directScore': 0.6812118902439024}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9413109756097561, 'directScore': 0.9413109756097561}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9801829268292683, 'directScore': 0.9801829268292683}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.9413109756097561, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 11.341334506182369, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'well-spent', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 11.320999630450851, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 11.341334506182369, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'personal-finance', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}]"
"Why Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Are Designing Their Own Chips"," In the process of transforming itself from an online bookstore into a cloud computing giant,   became one of the world’s largest purchasers of the computer chips that power data centers. As its cloud business has expanded, the company has become increasingly fixated on designing its own chips instead of buying them. The shift could have potentially drastic implications for a critical aspect of the technology industry—and could prove threatening for traditional chipmakers such as   and  Amazon began signaling its intentions in 2015 when it acquired  Annapurna Labs , a small Israeli chip designer. It’s since become aggressive about developing chips specifically designed for  Amazon Web Services ’ own data centers. “This work is foundational—when we improve the hardware, everything that runs on it improves,” says Nafea Bshara, an Annapurna co-founder who’s now an AWS vice president. Annapurna’s staff has grown tenfold since the  . Smugmug Inc. , an online photo service that uses AWS to show billions of photos to its users daily, says it’s reduced its AWS costs by as much as 40% just by shifting to an AWS service that runs on Amazon’s in-house chip, branded  . AWS mostly still relies on Intel chips, but Amazon charges Smugmug 20% less for services utilizing its own hardware, and Smugmug can buy less computing power because Amazon’s chips take 20% less time to run its tasks. “It results in a much lower bill for us without really having to do anything,” says Smugmug Chief Executive Officer Don MacAskill.  and  ’s Google are also working on  . In part, the trend reflects how different the current crop of tech giants are from the data center operators of the past, which didn’t have the resources to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into designing their own chips. There’s also a technical shift under way, ushered in by the rise of smartphones. While Intel and AMD were making chips for data centers that prioritized speed, mobile devices required processors that used as little power as possible, so the things wouldn’t die before the end of the day. As the demand for these devices  , there was immense incentive to improve the low-power chips, which began closing the gap in performance with the muscle-car models for data center business. Energy efficiency has become increasingly important. By 2025 data centers are expected to consume  , up from about 2% last year, according to Applied Materials, the biggest maker of chip manufacturing equipment. Keeping power consumption down is becoming more important than the cost of the chips themselves for the data center owners. The technology underlying low-power smartphone chips is made by  Arm Ltd. , a British semiconductor company that licenses it but doesn’t make chips itself. Amazon and Microsoft use Arm as the basis for their internal chip designs. The Graviton chips were initially used only in specialized cases but have developed into arguably the first Arm-based chips to be a credible competitor to Intel’s general-use data center offerings. “It’s a renaissance in semiconductors,” says  Jon Bathgate , an investor at Colorado-based investment firm  NZS Capital . As Amazon, Google, and Microsoft compete for cloud computing customers, the specific virtues of their chips may become a selling point, says Smugmug’s MacAskill. “It’s going to get pretty interesting when these cloud providers begin to differentiate themselves even further.” None of these companies manufacture the new chips they design; they rely on the same international supply chain that’s been   during the coronavirus pandemic. If such a crunch continues, it will slow their progress and eat into profits. Then there’s the pending acquisition of Arm by  , itself a designer of chips used in some data centers. Nvidia has promised to maintain open access to Arm’s technology and says it has no incentive to do otherwise. Some of Arm’s customers have already expressed concerns to regulators considering whether to approve the deal. These complaints are private, but Bloomberg News has   that Google, Microsoft, and   are among the companies that have made them. The surge in custom-made chips could further reduce the cost of advanced computing products and spark innovations, which would be good for everyone. Or almost everyone. To stay ahead of the newcomers, Intel has been   that make AI-specific chips while it dedicates massive resources to improving the efficiency of its cloud computing products and offers to design custom builds for its biggest customers. But NZS’s Bathgate thinks it will struggle to stay ahead. “This is an existential problem for Intel,” he says.  ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/why-amazon-amzn-google-googl-microsoft-msft-are-designing-own-chips,"[{'id': 'VOW:GR', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.007962433646386281, 'directScore': 0.007962433646386281}, {'id': 'AAPL:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.01347488770926909, 'directScore': 0.01347488770926909}, {'id': 'TSLA:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.016129032258064516, 'directScore': 0.016129032258064516}, {'id': 'QCOM:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.13679052674561046, 'directScore': 0.13679052674561046}, {'id': '005930:KS', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.426092282564312, 'directScore': 0.426092282564312}, {'id': 'AMAT:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.4777460187831768, 'directScore': 0.4777460187831768}, {'id': 'AMD:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 1.486320947325439, 'directScore': 1.486320947325439}, {'id': 'INTC:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 2.703756635361372, 'directScore': 2.703756635361372}, {'id': 'MSFT:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 5.467318369361847, 'directScore': 5.467318369361847}, {'id': 'GOOGL:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 6.220053265725273, 'directScore': 6.220053265725273}, {'id': 'AMZN:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 9.808688285806573, 'directScore': 9.808688285806573}, {'id': 'electric-vehicles', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.011637403021641487, 'directScore': 0.011637403021641487}, {'id': 'startups', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.08084932625561454, 'directScore': 0.08084932625561454}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.24295630869742751, 'directScore': 0.24295630869742751}, {'id': 'design', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.3127807268272764, 'directScore': 0.3127807268272764}, {'id': 'energy-efficiency', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.57411188240098, 'directScore': 0.57411188240098}, {'id': 'smartphone', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.027970600244998, 'directScore': 1.027970600244998}, {'id': 'hardware', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.5630869742752145, 'directScore': 1.5630869742752145}, {'id': 'cloud-computing', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.4409963250306244, 'directScore': 3.4409963250306244}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.007962433646386281, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'utilities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.94245258101794, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.24295630869742751, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg-concerns', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.57411188240098, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.426092282564312, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.426092282564312, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.94245258101794, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'small-business', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 11.547981283687083, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'mobile-phones', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.0280589162915532, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'KR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.426092282564312, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'climate-change', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.57411188240098, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'software-company', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.467318369361847, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5742298290532264, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 9.808703078781752, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets-economics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.426092282564312, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 11.547981283687083, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'technology', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 11.455820276146017, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'DE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.007962433646386281, 'directScore': 0}]"
The Curious Case of Hard-to-Find Workers," It’s Fed day. This afternoon the Federal Open Market Committee will issue a statement on its latest deliberations on monetary policy and then Chairman Jerome Powell will face questions from reporters. Here’s a question I hope someone will ask: How hard is it for businesses to find employees? This is a hugely important question for the Fed because if there are lots of available workers, wages will remain low and inflation will stay soft. If instead it’s hard to fill jobs, employers will have to raise wages. Then they might have to raise prices to cover the rising wage bill. And that’s inflation.  The chart at the top of this article is kind of a shocker. It shows that 40% of small businesses surveyed in February by the National Federation of Independent Business reported that they had jobs they couldn’t fill. That seasonally adjusted number is the highest percentage saying so in the history of the data series, which goes back to 1974. Higher than February 2020, when the unemployment rate tied a half-century low of 3.5%. Or the late 1990s, when the dot-com sector was booming. Taken by itself, it seems to show that wages could start spurting upward soon. The question for the Fed is how seriously to take this one statistic. Some other indicators also point to labor-market tightness. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported March 11 that there were 6.9 million unfilled jobs in the U.S. on the last day of January. That’s well above average, although unlike the small business group’s number, it’s not a record. (The record was 7.6 million in November 2018.) Another sign of labor-market tightness that somewhat supports the small-business data is that people are quitting their jobs at a high rate, seemingly confident that they can find something else quickly. According to the BLS, the “quits rate”—the number of people quitting as a share of total employment—was 2.3% in January, just a tenth of a percentage point below the record going back to 2001. Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research Inc., speculated March 11 in a note to clients that if workers are hard to find, it could be that their skills don’t match employers’ needs, or that people who could work are choosing to survive on extend unemployment benefits instead. But maybe it’s jobs, not workers, that are hard to find. The official unemployment rate in February was above average at 6.2%, and the BLS has   misclassifying some people on temporary layoff as “employed but not at work.” Adding them to the unemployed would boost the jobless rate by half a percent. That’s vs. 3.5% a year earlier. Also, some of the people who dropped out of the labor market during the pandemic and thus aren’t counted as unemployed are actually ready and willing to work. One way to see that is through the share of the U.S. adult population that’s employed: 57.6% in February. If that share returned to the level of a year earlier, 61.1%, it would represent about 8 million more people on the job. Josh Bivens, research director of the Economic Policy Institute, said in a news conference on March 16 that if employers are having trouble hiring, the first thing they tend to do is ask their current employees to work more hours to compensate. And in fact, average weekly hours worked in the private sector did jump in January, to 34.9, the highest in records going back to 2006. But the workweek fell 18 minutes in February to 34.6, which is at the high end of normal.  For workers, a tight labor market would be a blessing. They’re due for a raise. Even if wage growth starts exceeding productivity growth, the Fed has plenty of tools to keep inflation from getting out of control. Still, the Fed needs to keep tabs on this. Signs of tightness in the labor market, while not definitive, can’t be ignored.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/the-curious-case-of-hard-to-find-workers,"[{'id': '15046536', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.9595824411134903, 'directScore': 0.9595824411134903}, {'id': 'economic-policy-institute', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 0.20262312633832977, 'directScore': 0.20262312633832977}, {'id': 'federal-open-market-committee', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 1.3843683083511777, 'directScore': 1.3843683083511777}, {'id': 'federal-reserve', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 1.6788008565310493, 'directScore': 1.6788008565310493}, {'id': 'AONE:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.2716809421841542, 'directScore': 0.2716809421841542}, {'id': 'RESRQ:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.4684154175588865, 'directScore': 0.4684154175588865}, {'id': 'unemployment-benefits', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.41193790149892934, 'directScore': 0.41193790149892934}, {'id': 'employment', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.505085653104925, 'directScore': 0.505085653104925}, {'id': 'wage-growth', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9676124197002142, 'directScore': 0.9676124197002142}, {'id': 'monetary-policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.5033255211462935, 'directScore': 0.9686830835117773}, {'id': 'labor', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.0492505353319057, 'directScore': 1.0492505353319057}, {'id': 'unemployment-rate', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.5190042826552466, 'directScore': 2.5190042826552466}, {'id': 'jobs', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.4250894883185787, 'directScore': 3.4250894883185787}, {'id': 'small-business', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.193917990348046, 'directScore': 4.193917990348046}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 2.391181584719005, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.5033255211462935, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 2.087202351790221, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'materials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.4684154175588865, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.5033255211462935, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'banking', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.2495879173403837, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.5033255211462935, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'central-bankers', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.2495879173403837, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.5472028907922912, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.5472028907922912, 'directScore': 0}]"
Don’t Count on Bitcoin to Be a Sure-Thing Inflation Hedge," Hardcore Bitcoin enthusiasts say the digital coin is the world’s best hedge against rising consumer prices. The logic: Unlike U.S. dollars or any other normal currency, it’s designed to have a limited supply, so it can’t be devalued by a government or a central bank distributing too much of it. Almost every bull case on Bitcoin has looked prescient lately—the cryptocurrency is   at around $57,000 a coin, up from about $5,000 a year ago—so that’s added some buzz to this inflation story. With the economic outlook  , Covid-19 cases  , and greater amounts of   on the horizon, investors in all kinds of assets seem to expect a bit of a rise in prices. But that’s coming from a very  . Over the past year, the inflation rate in the U.S. has been 1.7%. And then there’s the question of whether the digital asset would really act as an effective hedge. It doesn’t have a long enough history to establish that, says  Cam Harvey , senior adviser to  Research Affiliates  and a professor of finance at Duke University. Theoretically, if investors come to regard it as similar to gold, Bitcoin might hold its value over a very long term—as in a century or more, Harvey says. In their research on gold, he and his colleagues have found that it has held its value well for millenniums. But they also found that it’s prone to manias and crashes over shorter periods. (Gold, notably, is down 9% this year  .) Bitcoin too has swung wildly in its short life, for reasons barely connected to anyone’s view on inflation. “What’s going to happen to Bitcoin? It’s really unclear,” Harvey says. “The price is not just driven by the money-supply rule, it’s driven by other speculative forces. That’s why it’s multiple times more volatile than the stock market.” It’s conceivable that a bout of inflation could have the opposite of the expected effect on Bitcoin. If inflation induced a recession, for example, investors might respond by stepping away from riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies. In recent weeks, when investors concerned about inflation pushed the 10-year Treasury yield from 1.34% to  , Bitcoin suffered its worst drop in months. Crypto proponents argue that Bitcoin traders long ago anticipated bond yields would rise—and a subsequent spike in yields did roughly track with a bump in crypto. Still, Bitcoin’s recent moves bear at least a passing resemblance to more straightforward speculative trades. Bitcoin has received a   from more than a handful of notable Wall Streeters, including veteran hedge fund manager  Paul Tudor Jones , who say they like it as a store of wealth. “That is certainly an element that has driven investment by institutions, particularly in the wake of the ways in which policymakers have worked to jump-start the economy” after the Covid slowdown, says  Michael Sonnenshein , chief executive officer at  Grayscale Investments , which runs  a fund that holds Bitcoin . “Certainly we have no shortage of global macro investors for whom adding Bitcoin has acted for them as a hedge for inflation.” Bitcoin’s strongest advocates see its rising price as an early-warning sign that the traditional financial system is vulnerable, and argue that the cryptocurrency could rise further as investors look for a haven. Such arguments hinge on the idea that inflation won’t just edge up with a growing economy, but could explode as a result of so-called  .  The Federal Reserve doesn’t change the money supply by literally printing bills. However, a measure of the amount of money in the financial system known as M2 has increased, thanks in part to accommodative policy. Fed Chairman  Jerome Powell  said in recent congressional testimony that the growth of the money supply no longer has important implications for the economic outlook. “We’ve had big growth of monetary aggregates at various times without inflation,” he said. “So it’s something we have to unlearn.” Jim Paulsen , chief investment strategist at the  Leuthold Group , agrees. While there may be more money, its velocity—or the frequency with which money changes hands—has dropped off. That’s a crucial factor because it shows money is being saved rather than spent, which keeps price pressures muted. But even if velocity turns higher, offsetting disinflationary forces could still come into play, including an aging population and digital technology’s propensity to push prices down. “Inflation is turning up a little bit, but I don’t think that means that crypto is going to go nuts,” Paulsen says. Bitcoin is unlike most other inflation hedges. Its value is based entirely on other people’s willingness to hold it: The digital token isn’t tied to any other asset, such as oil or real estate or earnings from a business, that might naturally rise in value along with consumer prices. It’s possible that inflation could go up and it’s possible that Bitcoin could too, but the two aren’t necessarily linked. One of Bitcoin’s best-known bulls,  Ark Investment Management  founder  Cathie Wood , said in a recent webinar that she’s as concerned about the forces of deflation—or falling prices—as she is with inflation. “The kindling wood for inflation exists,” says  Marc Chandler , chief market strategist at  Bannockburn Global Forex . “One has to make a judgment about whether there’s sufficient spark.” Instead of looking at Bitcoin prices as a weather vane of inflation, he prefers to look at signals such as oil prices, shipping costs, or the price of semiconductors. They’re   as the economy gains steam, but that doesn’t mean the dollar’s being undercut by a flood of printed money. “The high priests of the cryptocurrency space look for any reason to help their case,” he says. “I’m still hesitant to think that Bitcoin tells us anything about high-frequency economic variables.” —",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/is-bitcoin-an-inflation-hedge-the-opposite-effect-could-happen-in-recession,"[{'id': '15046536', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.36863070539419085, 'directScore': 0.36863070539419085}, {'id': '4138825', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.8078008298755187, 'directScore': 0.8078008298755187}, {'id': '1488933', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 2.380082987551867, 'directScore': 2.380082987551867}, {'id': 'USD:CUR', 'type': 'Currency', 'derivedScore': 0.05593360995850622, 'directScore': 0.05593360995850622}, {'id': 'federal-reserve', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 0.4053112033195021, 'directScore': 0.4053112033195021}, {'id': 'AONE:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.2645643153526971, 'directScore': 0.2645643153526971}, {'id': 'CL1:COM', 'type': 'Commodity', 'derivedScore': 0.2741908713692946, 'directScore': 0.2741908713692946}, {'id': 'GC1:COM', 'type': 'Commodity', 'derivedScore': 2.3862240663900414, 'directScore': 2.3862240663900414}, {'id': 'earnings', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.19302904564315354, 'directScore': 0.19302904564315354}, {'id': 'real-estate', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.19551867219917013, 'directScore': 0.19551867219917013}, {'id': 'policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.0709277307210163, 'directScore': 0.3721161825726141}, {'id': 'wealth', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5387551867219917, 'directScore': 0.5387551867219917}, {'id': 'bonds', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6028215767634855, 'directScore': 0.6028215767634855}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9125311203319502, 'directScore': 0.9125311203319502}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.8729974343093287, 'directScore': 0.9609958506224067}, {'id': 'currency', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9753823445999037, 'directScore': 0.9737759336099585}, {'id': 'fund-manager', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.0403319502074688, 'directScore': 1.0403319502074688}, {'id': 'investment-management', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.6662240663900414, 'directScore': 1.6662240663900414}, {'id': 'cryptocurrency', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 15.244262616485948, 'directScore': 5.09344398340249}, {'id': 'bitcoin', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 14.33966804979253, 'directScore': 14.33966804979253}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'energy', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.2741908713692946, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'monetary-policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9946224066390041, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'central-bankers', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.4053112033195021, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.9125311203319502, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.19551867219917013, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'futures-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.40197712055649, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'banking', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.4053112033195021, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.2704769962046471, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'personal-finance', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'commodity-futures', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.40197712055649, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 2.6056370695818036, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.2704769962046471, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'well-spent', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.1848822133062042, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'technology', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 15.244262616485948, 'directScore': 0}]"
British Courts Buckle From the Strain of Covid and Funding Cuts," Alejandra Llorente Tascon dreamed of becoming a criminal lawyer for years. Now the 27-year-old struggles to see a future for many of Britain’s public defenders. Based in London and self-employed (like most of the U.K.’s public defenders), Tascon says she generally earns less than the country’s hourly minimum wage after accounting for preparation work and advising clients. “The more time goes on, the more I question whether it is something I can do long term,” she says. After the financial crisis a decade ago, Britain’s liberal-conservative coalition government introduced austerity measures. Spending on publicly funded criminal legal defense declined by 35% (in real terms) from 2010 to 2020, according to Britain’s parliamentary library; spending on civil legal defense (for cases in areas such as housing and immigration) was also heavily hit. In recent years the government has also cut the number of “sitting days” for judges, leaving some courtrooms empty at certain periods. Lawyers have launched campaigns and  , warning the changes would damage Britain’s justice system and hinder the right to a fair and impartial trial. Then came Covid-19. In March 2020, as the pandemic swept across Britain, the government   and suspended hundreds of courts. When they reopened at reduced capacity, the coronavirus continued to affect trials, infecting judges, jurors, defendants, and lawyers—and fueling high backlogs of cases waiting to be heard. In the third quarter of 2020, the most recent period for which court statistics are available, there were more than 53,000 outstanding cases in England and Wales’s crown courts (which try more serious crimes)—a 44% increase from the previous year—and about 412,000 cases in lower-level (magistrates’) courts. Thomas Winsor, Britain’s chief policing inspector, told Parliament’s justice committee in January of his “grave concern” about the backlogs in a system already beset by delays, decaying buildings, and chronic underfunding. Delayed trials mean more people waiting longer in jail before judgment and sentencing and potentially weaker evidence, in part because people’s memories may fade over time. Tascon says she has clients in detention still waiting for news about when they may be tried, while one of her cases is now scheduled for 2023. “There is absolutely nothing I can do if the court hasn’t got the judges or the room to hear the cases,” she says. “Our hands are really tied.” By the time some of the outstanding trials take place, more criminal lawyers may have left their jobs. According to a December survey of self-employed barristers (who, like Tascon, argue cases in court) by the Bar Council, the organization that represents them, 61% said they’ve had to survive the pandemic on personal debt or savings, and 20% said they were unsure if they would renew their licenses to practice this year. The Bar Council has warned that the profession’s precariousness will particularly impact Black, Asian, and ethnic minority barristers and threaten the field’s diversity. In October the council noted that some junior barristers are earning less than £13,000 ($18,000) annually pretax. “The real danger of where we are now is that we will end up with a system far more like what you see in the United States public defender system,” says  David Lammy , who’s the justice spokesperson for Britain’s opposition Labour Party. Noting the regional disparities in the U.S. court system, he adds, “There are some exceptional jurisdictions with great public defenders, but the lion’s share of them just are not of the quality we’ve traditionally enjoyed in the U.K.” The risk, he says, is if there are fewer top criminal lawyers, the system will have to resort to “people who aren’t fully qualified to take [cases] forward and very junior lawyers.” Lammy, a former barrister himself, is also the author of a major government review into racial and ethnic disparities in Britain’s criminal justice system. Published in 2017, it noted that “there is greater disproportionality in the number of Black people in prisons here [in England and Wales] than in the United States.” Poorly funded criminal defense risks exacerbating inequities; deprived communities, often including minorities, would be less likely to access high-quality representation. In recent months the government has opened more than 20 pop-up courtrooms in several unusual venues, including theaters, cathedrals, and hotels, to combat the backlog of cases. More so-called Nightingale courts are in the works; last summer the head of the country’s court service said 200 additional venues would be needed to clear the backlog. A justice ministry spokesman says that “legal professionals are being supported through this challenging time,” noting the government is investing £450 million to modernize courtrooms and improve technology. An independent inquiry into the future of criminal defense funding is also under way. The government announced last year it would boost annual funding for the public defense sector, and it plans to increase judges’ sitting days again. But James Mulholland, chair of Britain’s Criminal Bar Association, says the government’s latest funding announcements are making little difference. Payment rates still remain “pretty much peanuts,” he says, and money isn’t filtering down to barristers, in part because fewer cases are being heard. Kate Brunner, a senior barrister focusing on murder cases, hopes that the independent inquiry will lead to further investment—and that the government and public will recognize the scale of the problem in Britain’s courts. If not, she’s fearful that many of the brightest lawyers will avoid her line of work. This would mean darker days still for the country’s justice system. “We really are at a crisis point,” she says.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/u-k-courts-under-stress-from-funding-cuts-covid-pandemic,"[{'id': 'london', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.9703315881326352, 'directScore': 0.9703315881326352}, {'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.4862129144851658, 'directScore': 0.4862129144851658}, {'id': '3956452Z:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.4164048865619546, 'directScore': 0.4164048865619546}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.7261780104712041, 'directScore': 0.7261780104712041}, {'id': 'investing', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.17574171029668412, 'directScore': 0.17574171029668412}, {'id': 'debt', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5207678883071554, 'directScore': 0.5207678883071554}, {'id': 'jobs', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5582897033158813, 'directScore': 0.5582897033158813}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7694589877835951, 'directScore': 0.7694589877835951}, {'id': 'immigration', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8598603839441535, 'directScore': 0.8598603839441535}, {'id': 'minimum-wage', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9478184991273997, 'directScore': 0.9478184991273997}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.6155322862129147, 'directScore': 3.6155322862129147}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.5207678883071554, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.5207678883071554, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'GB', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.0596788956269538, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 1.0596788956269538, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.7694589877835951, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg-concerns', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9478184991273997, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.7261780104712041, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5207678883071554, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'bonds', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5207678883071554, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'megacity', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9703315881326352, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5207678883071554, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.4164048865619546, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'UK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.0596788956269538, 'directScore': 0}]"
Boris Johnson Finally Tells Us What “Global Britain” Means," Until Tuesday “Global Britain” was a slogan and little more. Just over a year ago Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a punchy   where he likened post-Brexit Britain to superman. The U.K., he said, was “ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the earth to buy and sell freely among each other.” The long-awaited   into foreign and security policy, published this week, is the first serious stab at setting out how post-Brexit Britain fits into a changing world. It tells us how the U.K. government ranks the threats and risks it faces, where it sees opportunities and what role it wants to play in the world. It’s as close to a Johnson Doctrine as we’re likely to get. To the question, “What is Global Britain?” this provides an answer of sorts. Britain is a middling power in a multipolar world where, as the review puts it, “the geopolitical and economic center of gravity” is moving toward the Indo-Pacific region. The country is no longer a bridge between the U.S. and Europe.  Johnson is taking several steps to back up the Indo-Pacific pivot. The HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft-carrier strike group is being sent on a maiden operational mission to the region, and Johnson will visit India in April. Britain has been hoping for a free-trade deal with New Delhi (  partner outside the European Union). Indeed, it’s hard to see how an   succeeds without a strengthened relationship with the country. The new tilt has economic, security and broader foreign policy implications. The prime minister has invited the leaders of Australia, South Korea and India to attend the G7 summit in June — to be held in Cornwall — and submitted the U.K.’s application to join the Trans-Pacific free trade agreement. Like a new kid on the block eager to make friends fast, Britain will become a “dialogue partner” of the Association of South East Asian nations (ASEAN). The problem with all of this is China. Members of the China Research Group — an influential group of Tory lawmakers who want a harder line on Beijing to acknowledge security threats, the treatment of the Uighurs and the crackdown on Hong Kong — were left disappointed by the review. While Russia is described as an acute security threat, the risk from China is wordsmithed into a “systemic challenge.” The paper describes it as “the biggest state-based threat to the U.K.’s economic security,” but leaves plenty of room for partnership in some areas. There’s fence-sitting on Iran, too. Even so, the Integrated Review isn’t short on ambition or direction. Britain will strengthen its defenses by increasing the number of nuclear warheads on Trident submarines and modernizing its armed forces. It will enhance “resilience” at home through new counterterrorism capabilities, rebuilding the economy, preparing for another pandemic and fighting climate change. It will seek to become a “Science and Technology Superpower.” It will expand (recently reduced) international aid, promote a rules-based world order and use   to hold human rights abusers to account. While it’s hard to fault any of those goals, achieving them will be much trickier than setting them. Funding a grand strategy is where big planning often comes apart. The 114-page document reads like one of those glorious to-do lists that provide a flush of satisfaction when written down until you realize you actually have to deliver each item (and fund them). Security experts giving evidence to   ahead of the review warned there was often a gap between the ambitions of a wide-ranging policy review and the resources allocated to meet them. Given the pandemic’s vast cost and Johnson’s many promises to improve the lives of working-class communities, there will be a fight for cash. To take one example, the document describes action against climate change and biodiversity loss as Britain’s highest priority, but there has been no serious conversation about how to meet annual costs estimated at   ($69.5 billion) to meet the U.K.’s net zero target. There’s also a glaring omission in the grand vision: Europe. Almost nowhere is the EU mentioned, except with regard to security cooperation. Anyone looking at the U.K.’s goals objectively — or even a map — might wonder how the U.K. can omit an economic superpower and neighbor whose security and prosperity are so closely entwined with its own. One answer to the Europe question is that it’s too early for realism. Relations are poor, strained by a dispute over vaccine supply, the policing of goods into Northern Ireland — over which the EU has just launched legal action — and areas of the broader trading relationship that were left only loosely resolved after Brexit. Trade flows dwindled in January and it’s yet to be seen whether that was temporary. The other answer is political: Johnson’s goal is to rebuild Britain in a way that vindicates the decision to separate from Europe. Even after Brexit, a little punch-up with Europe has its political uses. I suspect a gradual realignment will happen over time, but neither side is in a hurry. In the meantime, Britain has set its sights elsewhere.

Elon Musk Has a Serious Rival: the TechnoKaiser," Volkswagen AG’s boss Herbert Diess is realistic about the threat posed by software-savvy and richly valued rivals such as Tesla Inc., but he’s adamant that VW can prevail. On current form, he may be right. The German car giant has added almost 45 billion euros ($53.5 billion) of market value so far this year and its shares are at their highest since 2015, when the diesel emissions scandal abruptly steered the company down a dark road. VW’s more widely traded preferred shares have climbed 36% since the start of January, far outstripping Tesla — which has declined slightly since then, having risen more than 700% in 2020. VW’s 125 billion-euro market capitalization is still barely a fifth of Tesla’s, and the German group’s investors still don’t ascribe full value to cash-generative premium brands like Porsche and a leading market position in China. Nevertheless, VW has the wind at its back suddenly. So what’s changed? Hints that the valuable Porsche franchise might get a   have helped, even though VW’s management gave the impression this week that it’s not an immediate priority. The rotation in equity markets away from scarcely profitable growth stocks toward those likely to benefit most from the post-pandemic recovery has also played a role. Analysts expect VW to generate a whopping 16 billion euros of operating profit this year. As  , another big difference is that VW has become far more adept at highlighting its hugely ambitious electric-vehicle strategy. Diess has taken Musk’s self-promotional routine, hewn off the rough edges, and thrown it back at him. Thanks to new battery-powered models such as the VW ID3, Audi e-tron and Porsche Taycan, VW’s electric-vehicle plan has become a lot more credible. The group is already the largest seller of battery vehicles  , and globally it could draw level with Tesla in electric-car sales  . By 2030 about half of the group’s new car sales will be electric vehicles. To meet that demand it has outlined plans to build half a dozen battery plants in Europe together with external partners. VW’s investment in   QuantumScape Corp. has paid off, too, at least on paper. VW booked a 1.4 billion-euro gain on the investment in its  . VW still lags behind Tesla in vital areas like “over the air” vehicle software updates and autonomous driving but it has a credible plan to catch up. VW will develop its own   rather than rely on Google or any other Silicon Valley import, an effort that will cost billions of euros. If, at the end, VW is valued more like a software company than a metal basher, the money will have been well spent. For those who fear Europe is destined to lose its industrial edge to the U.S. and China, this is very encouraging. Few could afford to take such risks but VW has 27 billion euros of net liquidity and analysts expect it to keep generating heaps more cash. In the past VW’s heavy spending seemed to benefit its engineers more than it did investors. The company has 670,000 employees — a potential future problem given that making an electric vehicle is less labor intensive than producing one powered by a combustion engine. The company’s sheer size can become an advantage, Diess insists: The more vehicles that incorporate its hardware and software, the more easily it can amortize those investments. In a sop to number-crunching analysts, he has promised to   by 5% by 2023. Retail investors have been the ones setting the direction of the stock market lately — and   in VW’s less-traded ordinary shares on Tuesday. These amateur investors   and VW is no longer too proud to borrow some crowd-pleasing ideas from Musk. The company held a livestreamed   event this week to showcase its battery activities, which shamelessly copied Tesla’s battery and autonomy events. VW spoke about building a network of “gigafactories,” using Musk’s sexy terminology for battery production facilities. Though less at home with meme culture and cryptocurrencies than his rival, Diess also uses  to push the message that VW should be valued like a tech company. One thing he hasn’t done yet is given himself   like the Technoking of Tesla. But if Diess keeps this up, his anointment as TechnoKaiser can’t be far off.

Central Bankers Have Lost the Plot on Messaging," It’s a big week for central bank meetings, with the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday, the Bank of England Thursday and the Bank of Japan wrapping it up on Friday. My plea is that they keep it simple. Central bank messaging really doesn’t have to be as difficult as it has become lately — with a plethora of jargon-infected initiatives adding to investors’ pain. This isn’t the time to communicate intentions unclearly, nor to introduce confusing and unnecessary new policies. Give it to us straight; it’ll be easier in the long run. The European Central Bank’s meeting last week was a perfect example of what to do and what not to do. The initial statement provided all the reassurance the markets wanted. The pace of the ECB’s pandemic quantitative easing program would be “significantly raised” to counteract a recent rise in bond yields. Nothing more was needed. Unfortunately the press conference afterwards by ECB President Christine Lagarde only muddied the waters as she tried to explain a new “ ” approach to maintaining favorable financial conditions. I’ve yet to find a cogent explanation of what that means. This was compounded by an increasingly common habit of central banks: post-meeting “sources” trying to   the message conveyed. A more hawkish-sounding leak — insisting that most ECB policy makers had no intention of expanding the size of the emergency stimulus program, and had agreed only to speed it up — caused German bunds to swiftly unwind their earlier price gains. It was also implied that QE can only be ratcheted up or down at the quarterly ECB meeting, which isn’t the flexibility the pandemic program promised. These mixed messages on the ECB’s resolve to stem rising borrowing costs will inevitably   price volatility. It also gives the impression that the governing council is not united. Defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory. Fed Chair Jay Powell has been almost as frustrating in his market communications. He’s been sphinx-like in his refusal to comment on rising yields, no doubt with one eye on trying to deflate speculative bubbles. The Fed is putting its faith in a nebulous concept called “flexible average inflation targeting” — essentially letting the economy run hot and letting price gains go above the official 2% target. But without a specific timeline or an indication of how much inflation is too much it becomes meaningless. The rout in bond markets has seen five-year U.S. Treasury yields more than double since the start of the year. Keeping schtum or hiding behind vague concepts only works for a short time. The Bank of England is far from innocent in its mangled communications. It has tied itself in knots over whether it’s   to take its benchmark rate negative. Though at least Governor Andrew Bailey was clear, in an interview Monday, that the recent yield rise   about the economy.  The need to complicate things appears to be contagious. Since September 2016, the Bank of Japan has successfully controlled 10-year government bond yields with a modicum of flexibility. Yet a   expected on Friday has precipitated a selloff that required Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to   on some of the wilder expectations of what will change. What was the value of having the review at all? A simple and effective policy has become confusing. We are at an economic inflection point of emerging from a deep recession into what might be super-strong growth led by vast government spending packages. This poses a dilemma for central banks, which have grown used to being the sole tip of the stimulus spear for more than a decade. How do they quietly extract themselves from the battle without causing an implosion in unstable markets hooked on unlimited QE and rock-bottom policy rates? This is why it’s paramount for the Fed and the rest to keep it simple over where they see the balance of risks. Huge change deserves as much clarity as possible.

Biden Needs a Syria Policy to Fix Trump and Obama Mistakes," The 10th anniversary of the Syrian uprising has come and gone with scarce acknowledgment from the Biden administration. The president and his foreign-policy mandarins, so righteously vocal about Yemen, the Middle East’s second-largest humanitarian catastrophe, have had not much to say on the much larger and longer-lasting calamity 1,500 miles to the north. It is tempting to chalk up this relative silence to a sense of shame. After all, many in Biden’s foreign-policy team were in the Obama administration, which did little other than talk as Syria’s dictator Bashar al-Assad unleashed horror upon horror on his opponents. Antony Blinken, then a member of Obama’s national-security team and now Biden’s Secretary of State, has even acknowledged that the policy failures led to calamities  Yet on Monday Blinken could only bring himself to release   of reproach and remonstration for the Assad regime. What’s more, it was a joint statement, co-signed by his German, British, French and Italian counterparts. Apparently, the Biden team’s remit of   doesn’t run to Syria. Blinken has called out Trump for taking away “any remaining leverage in Syria” by shrinking the U.S. military footprint there. Yet he and Biden seem sanguine about maintaining the bare minimum of American troops on the ground, alongside Trump’s  . The most significant military action Biden has authorized on Syrian soil was designed to   and its proxy militias in Iraq, not to the government in Damascus.  Biden may not be as blunt as Trump, who described Syria as a land of   but there is nothing to suggest the president differs from his predecessor on assessing the country’s strategic significance. In a reflection of the new administration’s foreign-policy priorities, Biden has not named a permanent envoy on Syria, whereas he has   to perform that role for Yemen and  . But Syria’s geopolitical importance, like its humanitarian tragedy, is too great to be ignored or wished away. The passivity of Obama and Trump allowed the likes of Russia, Turkey and Iran to expand their influence in the war-ravaged country, and Biden may find that his actions — or inaction — in Syria will have a bearing on his dealings with Moscow, Ankara and Tehran. More generally, Syria will challenge the sincerity of the president’s pledge to root his foreign policy “in  ,” including the defense of freedom and human rights. There will be important tests ahead. In the next couple of months, Assad plans to hold a presidential election, its outcome preordained. In July, Russia will again brandish its veto in the United Nations Security Council to  ; Moscow wants the assistance to be channeled through Damascus, which would allow Assad to starve any opposition to his regime. There are also military flashpoints to come. The regime, with Russian backing, is limbering up for a fresh assault on the opposition’s stronghold of Idlib,  . And there are worrying  , with the terrorist group taking advantage of the U.S. military drawdown as well as the impact of the coronavirus on Syrian security forces. To deal with these challenges, the Biden administration will need to quickly rebuild its leverage. This may require bolstering the American military presence and restoring support for   but were then left unprotected against a Turkish advance into northern Syria. In turn, this will mean facing down Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom Biden   but who is nonetheless a NATO ally.  The administration will also need to corral international support to head off Assad’s political maneuverings at the pass. If the dictator goes ahead with the charade of a presidential election with the support of Russia and Iran, the U.S. must ensure that the results are roundly rejected. It will need to build more pressure on Assad and his patrons to comply with a   stipulating presidential and parliamentary elections under UN supervision. And Biden will need to overcome his   to draw one of his own: Assad has to go. A president committed to democratic values simply cannot allow the man responsible for the 21st century’s worst carnage to remain in power. Allies minded to mend fences with the regime,  , must know that this will put them on bad footing with the White House.  These are challenges of a high order, and the problems of Syria are much more complex than, say,  . But the Biden administration may have more leverage than Blinken lets on. Ten years of war have left  , and Assad’s partners-in-crime, who have economic worries of their own, will struggle to bail him out. Anybody inclined to try can be dissuaded by the imposition of sanctions under the   which can be deployed against foreign investors, whether they be Russian, Chinese, Iranian — or indeed Emirati. A robust application of sanctions and the appointment of a Syria envoy would send important signals of Biden’s resolve to rectify the failures of his predecessors. They might even give his Secretary of State something salutary to take with him for the rest of his days.

"Biden Agrees Putin Is Killer, Says He’ll Pay Price for Meddling"," President  Joe Biden  agreed that Russian President  Vladimir Putin  is a “killer,” and said in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday that Russia would pay for alleged interference in U.S. elections. His comments, recorded Tuesday, came the same day as a U.S. intelligence community report that Putin ordered influence operations to hurt Biden’s candidacy, favoring former President  Donald Trump  just as the intelligence community says the Russian leader did in 2016 against then-Democratic presidential candidate  Hillary Clinton . Putin “will pay a price” for the interference, Biden said. In a “long talk” with the Russian leader, Biden said he told him, “I know you and you know me. If I establish this occurred, then be prepared.” After ABC News Chief Anchor  George Stephanopoulos  asked Biden if he believes Putin is “a killer,” Biden murmured agreement and said “I do,” without elaborating. Russia’s ruble sank as much as 1.6% to 74 per dollar, its biggest intraday loss since Feb. 25. The benchmark MOEX index also extended declines, and was down 2.1% as of 2:37 p.m. in Moscow. Ten-year bond yields were up three basis points at 6.84%, near their highest in a year. Vyacheslav Volodin , the speaker of the lower house of Russia’s parliament and a longtime Putin ally, dismissed Biden’s comments as “hysterics born of helplessness,” saying they “insult the citizens of our country.” Many officials in Putin’s government and associates of the Russian leader already live under U.S. sanctions due to previous rounds of punishment for election interference, attacks on political opponents and Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, leaving unclear what Biden may target. CNN reported that the U.S. may sanction more Putin associates. Biden said that in a past conversation with Putin, he told him that he “looked in your eyes and I don’t think you have a soul.” The remark was a reference to George W. Bush’s 2001 assessment of Putin, when the former U.S. president said that “I looked the man in the eye” and “was able to get a sense of his soul.” In December, then-Director of National Intelligence and Trump ally  John Ratcliffe  held up completion of Tuesday’s report, saying it needed to more fully reflect the national security threat posed by China, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of the information. But in the end the report indicated that China did not “deploy interference efforts” in an effort to change the election outcome. Earlier Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  denounced the U.S. intelligence report as “absolutely groundless.” “It’s regrettable that the beginning of each presidential term in the U.S. seems to be linked to imposing sanctions on Russia,” he said.

Russia Considers Spending Wealth Fund Billions on Infrastructure," Russia may spend billions of dollars from its wealth fund this year on infrastructure and other investments, and projects related to  ’s huge Vostok Oil venture in the Arctic are high on the list of candidates, according to two officials with knowledge of the discussions. The largesse could represent a significant boost in spending as the government has been cutting back on other stimulus introduced last year amid the coronavirus pandemic, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that aren’t yet public. President  Vladimir Putin  last week gave the government a month to draw up a list of specific investments for the fund. Thanks to the rise in oil prices, the wealth fund, which accumulates excess revenue from the fuel, is on track to top $200 billion this year. Though Russia suffered a relatively modest recession amid the pandemic last year, the recovery is expected to be sluggish and a jolt of state spending could help accelerate it. Russia has invested billions from the fund in the past in projects linked to big state companies. In a statement early Wednesday, Rosneft said that it has not asked for government funding for any of its projects, including Vostok Oil, which it said does not require long-term state financing. The company didn’t comment on whether the wealth fund might invest in related infrastructure. Finance Minister  Anton Siluanov  said Wednesday money from the wealth fund could begin flowing in the first half of this year, with spending totaling 1 trillion rubles ($14 billion) over 3 years. He said a high-speed-rail project between Moscow and St. Petersburg was a likely recipient. The Economy Ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment for this article. Dmitry Dolgin , analyst at ING Bank in Moscow, said the government could spend as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product, or $23 billion from the wealth fund this year. ”Spending on infrastructure creates much less inflationary pressure than the same amount spent on an increase of wages and pensions,” said  Tatiana Orlova , an analyst at Emerginomics in London. “This kind of stimulus is better because it creates less risk of the economy overheating.” Still, central bank officials have already expressed concern that a burst of new spending could fuel inflation, which is already running above target. Those worries are among the reasons the central bank is considering   faster than originally planned this year. The Finance Ministry has sought to impose strict criteria for selecting the ventures to make sure they’re economical, requiring majority participation by private investors, for example.

Rosneft Chief Executive Officer  Igor Sechin  presented Putin a   of crude from an early well last year, pronouncing it “even better than in the Middle East.” Located in the remote Taimyr region, the project requires massive investment in basic infrastructure like roads and rail links. Rosneft has already received tax breaks for another project to help pay for some of the Vostok Oil work. The wealth fund has stepped in to pay for such things for other ventures in the past. No final decisions yet have been made on how much to spend from the fund this year or which projects will get cash, the people said. “We need to reevaluate one more time which projects have detailed plans and are ready to start and be decided on,” Putin   last week during a meeting with officials and business executives on boosting investment. “And after such evaluation we need to launch them immediately.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/russia-mulls-spending-wealth-fund-billions-on-infrastructure,"[{'id': 'Middleeast', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.20087336244541484, 'directScore': 0.20087336244541484}, {'id': 'ROSN:RM', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 6.123105059907691, 'directScore': 6.123105059907691}, {'id': 'london', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.43695414847161573, 'directScore': 0.43695414847161573}, {'id': 'st-petersburg', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.5622270742358079, 'directScore': 0.5622270742358079}, {'id': 'moscow', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 1.0859716157205241, 'directScore': 1.0859716157205241}, {'id': 'executives', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.026200873362445413, 'directScore': 0.026200873362445413}, {'id': 'interest-rates', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.3490720524017467, 'directScore': 0.3490720524017467}, {'id': 'gdp', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5051855895196506, 'directScore': 0.5051855895196506}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.88264192139738, 'directScore': 0.88264192139738}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.674794974988966, 'directScore': 2.947598253275109}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 7.596068573974215, 'directScore': 7.596068573974215}, {'id': 'wealth', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 10.26854017415448, 'directScore': 10.26854017415448}, {'id': '3144256', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.23171397379912664, 'directScore': 0.23171397379912664}, {'id': '17008974', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.449235807860262, 'directScore': 0.449235807860262}, {'id': '1890338', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.6241812227074236, 'directScore': 0.6241812227074236}, {'id': '1920085', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 1.1181768558951966, 'directScore': 1.1181768558951966}, {'id': 'CL1:COM', 'type': 'Commodity', 'derivedScore': 4.142556605386253, 'directScore': 4.142556605386253}, {'id': 'RU', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 12.530217340608258, 'directScore': 10.79339519650655}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.5485173197083408, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'GB', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.43695414847161573, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'energy', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 7.524418205846754, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.3705074102185024, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'monetary-policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.3705074102185024, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 11.790170910587946, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.88264192139738, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 12.530217340608258, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'brics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 12.530217340608258, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.3705074102185024, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'megacity', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.1738785762260604, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'futures-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.142556605386253, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'commodity-futures', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.142556605386253, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'UK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.43695414847161573, 'directScore': 0}]"
Merkel’s Bloc Sinks Amid Calls for Health Minister’s Removal," Support for German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s conservative bloc slumped to its lowest in a year as discontent over the government’s handling of the vaccination rollout mounts and some opposition leaders called for her to fire the health minister. The stuttering pace of inoculation, irritation with months of lockdown restrictions and a scandal over allegations that some conservative lawmakers profited from the pandemic have eroded the CDU/CSU group’s backing, a Forsa opinion poll showed Wednesday. It followed the bloc’s poor showing in two regional votes on Sunday and suggests that it is losing steam ahead of September’s national election while the Greens gain momentum. After climbing as high as 40% last spring, backing for the CDU/CSU dropped by four percentage points compared with the previous week to 29%, the lowest since last March, according to the poll for broadcaster RTL. The Greens -- who on Sunday strengthened their hold on power in Baden-Wuerttemberg and had the biggest increase in support in Rhineland-Palatinate -- gained three points to 21% in second place, the highest since late November. The Social Democrats, the junior partners in Merkel’s government, remained at 16% in third. The bad news for Merkel’s bloc comes as pressure on her to deal with Germany’s missteps in handling the pandemic mounts. Opposition leaders on Wednesday slammed Health Minister  Jens Spahn  for his decision to suspend use of  ’s Covid-19 vaccine amid concerns over its safety. There was more evidence of the pandemic’s impact on Europe’s biggest economy Wednesday, as Merkel’s panel of advisers predicted weaker growth this year and warned the recovery could be jeopardized by a renewed spike in infections. German output will expand by 3.1% in 2021,  , trimming a forecast of 3.7% published in November. Next year, they expect growth to accelerate to 4%, underpinned by a pickup in consumer spending and strong demand for German exports, but warned that a “third wave” of infections is a significant threat. Wolfgang Kubicki , deputy leader of the liberal FDP party, said replacing Spahn “would help to renew the population’s trust in the state” even if there are only a few months left until the election. Spahn had been too late with the adoption of face masks and the government’s testing and vaccination strategy also failed, he told Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland, adding that the minister “is not   the job.” “With the uncoordinated and badly communicated suspension of AstraZeneca vaccinations, Spahn has further undermined trust in the vaccination strategy,”  Katrin Goering-Eckardt , the Greens’ caucus co-chief, told the Funke media group. A spokeswoman for the Health Ministry declined to comment. Germany and other European states suspended the use of Astra shots amid reports of blood clots in some recipients, while the European Union’s drug regulator has repeatedly said its benefits outweigh the risks. At the same time, the number of Covid-19 infections and deaths in Germany remains stubbornly high, prompting epidemiologists to say that the country has entered a “third wave” of the pandemic. That raises the prospect of a planned cautious lifting of restrictions being postponed and the current curbs extended into April. Coronavirus cases in Germany rose the most in almost a week, and the country’s seven-day incidence rate per 100,000 people climbed to the highest in more than a month, data showed Wednesday. The two state elections last Sunday gave voters a first opportunity to express their anger at the ballot box over Germany’s many problems in dealing with the pandemic. Conservative leaders vowed to step up their campaign to lead Germany’s next government after the CDU crashed to its worst-ever results in its former strongholds. If the election were held now, the conservatives and Greens would together command a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament, the poll indicated. Other potential coalitions -- including the Greens, SPD and liberal Free Democrats, or the Greens, SPD and the far-left Die Linke -- would fall short. Evidence of rising voter dissatisfaction will pile more pressure on  Armin Laschet , the new leader of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. Laschet is hoping to run as the conservative chancellor candidate to replace Merkel after September’s national vote, but is relatively unpopular compared to his main rival for the nomination, Bavaria Premier  Markus Soeder . If German voters were able to elect their chancellor directly, 36% would choose Soeder, the Forsa poll showed. His potential challenger from the Greens, co-leader  Robert Habeck , would score 20% and the SPD’s candidate, Finance Minister  Olaf Scholz , 15%. If Laschet ran for the conservatives, he would only garner 21%, compare with 22% for Habeck and 20% for Scholz. The Forsa poll of 2,501 people was conducted March 9-15 and has a margin of error of +/- 2.5 points.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/merkel-s-bloc-sinks-below-30-support-in-new-german-poll,"[{'id': '1646655', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.1633450566627589, 'directScore': 0.1633450566627589}, {'id': '3695827', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.31438061742868306, 'directScore': 0.31438061742868306}, {'id': '3777630', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.4847596717467761, 'directScore': 0.4847596717467761}, {'id': '1516502', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 11.611786235095645, 'directScore': 11.611786235095645}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 3.688423093355423, 'directScore': 2.192457991402892}, {'id': 'the-left-germany', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 0.7602579132473622, 'directScore': 0.7602579132473622}, {'id': 'us-democrats', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 0.9917936694021102, 'directScore': 0.9917936694021102}, {'id': 'social-democratic-party-of-germany', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 1.2430636967565454, 'directScore': 1.2430636967565454}, {'id': 'christian-social-union-in-bavaria', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 1.770418132082845, 'directScore': 1.770418132082845}, {'id': 'christian-democratic-union-of-germany', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 2.1750683860883155, 'directScore': 2.1750683860883155}, {'id': 'AZN:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 1.2250879249706916, 'directScore': 1.2250879249706916}, {'id': 'DE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 2.5379054318093006, 'directScore': 2.5379054318093006}, {'id': 'media', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.4718640093786635, 'directScore': 0.4718640093786635}, {'id': 'elections', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.4902305588120359, 'directScore': 0.4902305588120359}, {'id': 'exports', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6201641266119577, 'directScore': 0.6201641266119577}, {'id': 'consumer-spending', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.629347401328644, 'directScore': 0.629347401328644}, {'id': 'liberal', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7971864009378663, 'directScore': 0.7971864009378663}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.4865181711606097, 'directScore': 1.4865181711606097}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.111891077879125, 'directScore': 4.111891077879125}, {'id': 'conservative', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.768254558278291, 'directScore': 4.768254558278291}, {'id': 'GB', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.2250879249706916, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'politics', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 11.65414210794547, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'retail', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.629347401328644, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'industrials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.2250879249706916, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.9913355534927755, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'culture', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.1164097523953822, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'science', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.091192866537261, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'german-election', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.217266494295531, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.629347401328644, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'media-and-entertainment', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.4718640093786635, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'global-trade', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6201641266119577, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'UK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.2250879249706916, 'directScore': 0}]"
Danish Vessel to Fight Piracy in Most Perilous Shipping Area," Denmark will send a naval vessel to West Africa’s Gulf of Guinea to aid the fight against rampant piracy. The decision follows a call by A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and shipping industry groups for a more assertive international response to kidnappings that occur in the region. The waters in the area are the most dangerous for seafarers worldwide, accounting for almost all maritime abductions in recent years. The Danish government will deploy a frigate equipped with a helicopter to patrol international waters in the gulf from November for an initial period of five months, according to a statement published Tuesday. The vessel will combat piracy by providing escorts to civilian shipping and carrying out rescue operations following attacks, it said. The deployment is welcome as “regional countries currently do not have the capabilities needed to suppress piracy,” said Jakob Larsen, head of maritime security at BIMCO, one of the world’s largest industry groups for shipowners. It will provide a litmus test of how West African coastal states support and facilitate such initiatives, he said in an emailed statement. The vessel should be permitted to operate unhindered as long as it steers clear of individual countries’ territorial waters, he said. Last year, 95% of the 135 seafarers   were kidnapped in the gulf, a vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean stretching from Senegal to Angola, in 22 separate incidents, according to the International Maritime Bureau. Hostages are usually taken to Nigeria, where ransoms are negotiated. Copenhagen-based Maersk, the world’s biggest shipping company, is responsible for more than a third of maritime trade in the gulf, while as many as 40 Danish-operated vessels sail through the area daily. Maersk said in January that “effective military capacity” needs to be dispatched to the region. “If we are to get serious about managing security in the Gulf of Guinea, an international military presence is necessary,” Danish Defense Minister  Trine Bramsen  said in Tuesday’s statement. “We are working for more countries to assume a responsibility.” Nigeria, a front-runner in combating piracy in the region, is opposed to allowing commercial ships in the nation’s waters to carry weapons even if they are in transit, claiming recent investment in equipment and training will phase out the need for private security providers. A spokesman for the nation’s defense ministry didn’t immediately respond to questions about Denmark’s announcement. “We   other countries will consider supporting the Danish antipiracy operations,” Larsen said.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/denmark-dispatches-vessel-to-west-african-gulf-to-fight-piracy,"[{'id': '20544648', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.6689505950234402, 'directScore': 0.6689505950234402}, {'id': 'MAERSKB:DC', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.7111431662459431, 'directScore': 0.7111431662459431}, {'id': 'Africa', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 4.3971477762956965, 'directScore': 3.6601617639482766}, {'id': 'defense-ministry', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.33285250631085467, 'directScore': 0.33285250631085467}, {'id': 'military', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.565452578434908, 'directScore': 0.565452578434908}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0.8265416516408222}, {'id': 'AO', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.4478903714388749, 'directScore': 0.4478903714388749}, {'id': 'SN', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.4518571943743238, 'directScore': 0.4518571943743238}, {'id': 'NG', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.6509195816804905, 'directScore': 0.6509195816804905}, {'id': 'GN', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 3.0947503992581527, 'directScore': 3.0947503992581527}, {'id': 'DK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 4.129248375657985, 'directScore': 4.0670753696357735}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 4.129248375657985, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'industrials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7111431662459431, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6509195816804905, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'materials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7111431662459431, 'directScore': 0}]"
Top Belgian Soccer Team Has Star Power at Heart of IPO Pitch," Club Brugge is about to join a select group of listed European soccer teams, offering investors a chance to back its promise of unearthing the next stars of the game. The leaders of Belgium’s top division will go public via an initial public offering in Brussels on or around March 26, according to a   prospectus. Grizzly Sports NV, an investor group led by Chairman Bart Verhaeghe, will sell at least 30% of Club Brugge at 17.50 euros to 22.50 euros per share, giving it a market value of 229 million euros ($272 million) at the mid-point. Verhaeghe is betting that a model of nurturing young talent and selling it on to the free-spending teams of Europe’s biggest leagues, where players are often bought in for eye-watering sums, will play a major part in wooing investors. “We are making stars,” said Verhaeghe, who nearly became a professional player at 18 only to be steered toward law school by his father. “Other teams are consuming stars.” Club Brugge adopts a data-driven approach to spotting and developing young players. Its regular participation in elite European competitions, including the UEFA Champions League, also helps it attract youngsters and then gives them a shop window to display their skills to potential suitors. In 2019, Club Brugge sold the Brazilian attacker Wesley Moraes and Zimbabwean midfielder Marvelous Nakamba to the U.K.’s Aston Villa F.C. in deals worth about 36 million euros combined, according to figures from the club. This year, Senegalese winger Krepin Diatta moved from Club Brugge to France’s AS Monaco for almost 17 million euros. The club’s latest hot prospect is Belgian youngster Charles De Ketelaere. “We have a unique way of making players the best version of themselves and we are dominant in the local market,” Verhaeghe said. “We educate this talent and if they do well they can move on to one of the top five leagues in Europe.” The Belgian club will join a small number of European soccer teams, including AFC Ajax, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus F.C. and Manchester United F.C., in having shares listed in the public markets. The sector has lagged broader European stocks over the last three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A  Deutsche Boerse AG  index of European soccer teams was closed down last summer because of lack of interest. “This is a club coming to the stock market where we are looking to make a profit,” Verhaeghe said. “I’d like to be listing as a company in a growing market but unfortunately some of my peers don’t run things in the same way.” Club Brugge saw   rise 148% to 24 million euros on operating income of 120 million euros in the year through June 2020, according to its IPO prospectus. To be sure, the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 crisis on soccer’s finances has dampened the market for buying and selling players, with even big-spenders like Manchester City F.C. and Real Madrid exercising caution in recent transfer windows. Club Brugge said its financial performance has been “resilient” amid the pandemic. Half of the club’s roughly 24,300 season ticket holders have not asked for refunds despite months of not being able to attend matches, Verhaeghe said. The club has plans to move into a new 40,000-seat stadium. “It will be like going from a Lada to Mercedes,” Verhaeghe said. Grizzly Sports will remain Club Brugge’s largest shareholder after the IPO and Verhaeghe will keep his role as chairman, according to the prospectus.  ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. ,  Berenberg  and Belfius Bank are working on the listing.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/club-brugge-puts-soccer-star-power-at-heart-of-ipo-pitch,"[{'id': 'madrid', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.17632719393282772, 'directScore': 0.17632719393282772}, {'id': '17409472', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 4.407908992416035, 'directScore': 4.407908992416035}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 6.448073762282693, 'directScore': 6.313143898355166}, {'id': 'JPM:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.020314192849404118, 'directScore': 0.020314192849404118}, {'id': 'CSGN:SW', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.026543878656554713, 'directScore': 0.026543878656554713}, {'id': 'DAI:GR', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.07340195016251354, 'directScore': 0.07340195016251354}, {'id': 'DB1:GR', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.4022210184182015, 'directScore': 0.4022210184182015}, {'id': 'MANU:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.6367822318526544, 'directScore': 0.6367822318526544}, {'id': 'MC', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.86863488624052, 'directScore': 0.86863488624052}, {'id': 'FR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.8751354279523293, 'directScore': 0.8751354279523293}, {'id': 'BE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.9512459371614301, 'directScore': 0.9512459371614301}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.18147345612134344, 'directScore': 0.18147345612134344}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.21695557963163598, 'directScore': 0.21695557963163598}, {'id': 'stocks', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.4228060671722644, 'directScore': 0.4228060671722644}, {'id': 'law', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7524377031419285, 'directScore': 0.7524377031419285}, {'id': 'sports', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9758938244853738, 'directScore': 0.9758938244853738}, {'id': 'ipos', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.092768147345613, 'directScore': 4.092768147345613}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.6903693185352997, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.4353936411786177, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.21695557963163598, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'culture', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.6371062566216261, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'CH', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.026543878656554713, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6410127568407533, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.6371062566216261, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'DE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.4089186374397642, 'directScore': 0}]"
EU Revives U.K. Vaccine Export Fight Over Missing Supplies," European Commission President  Ursula von der Leyen  threatened to withhold vaccine exports to the U.K., reopening a dispute with the British government that has dramatically increased tensions between the EU and its former member. As the European Union struggles to quicken the pace of its stuttering Covid vaccination program, von der Leyen raised the prospect of pulling an emergency trigger in the bloc’s treaty -- used previously only during the oil crisis of the 1970s -- to allow authorities to effectively seize control of production and distribution. She said the EU will consider blocking supplies to countries that aren’t reciprocating or which already have high vaccination rates, singling out the U.K. as the No. 1 importer of shots. “All options are on the table, we are in the crisis of the century,” von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday. “I am not ruling out anything for now because we have to make sure that Europeans are vaccinated as soon as possible.” The threat comes as the bloc’s vaccine rollout is in a state of chaos. A number of countries suspended the use of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine to examine side effects even though the EU’s drugs regulator has repeatedly said the benefits of the shot outweigh risks. The World Health Organization reiterated its view that the vaccine should continue to be administered ahead of a highly anticipated review from the European Medicines Agency on Thursday. France has said it would follow the EMA’s advice. As Britain’s vaccination campaign continues to outstrip Europe’s, with almost four times the rate of doses administered, Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  said he’s getting his coronavirus vaccination “very shortly” -- and it “will certainly be Oxford-AstraZeneca I’ll be having.” The U.K. has insisted the Astra shot is safe and effective and urged the public to take it. Earlier, U.K. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told LBC Radio that comments from some politicians in Europe about the safety of the vaccine were “very, very unhelpful.” The EU has now administered 11 doses per 100 people, compared to 33 doses in the U.S. and 39 doses in the U.K., according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Despite the delays, the bloc boosted the number of doses it expects to get in the second quarter to 360 million.  The EU hinted at banning exports to the U.K. in January but that prospect faded after von der Leyen suggested she had received assurances from Johnson that Astra supplies to Europe wouldn’t be restricted.  “We have observed that in the last six weeks, 10 million doses have been exported to the U.K.,” she said. “If the situation doesn’t change, we will have to reflect on how to make exports to vaccine-producing countries dependent on their level of openness.” Von der Leyen said that EU leaders should consider additional measures to secure vaccine supplies when they meet next week, including the potential use of emergency legal powers to effectively seize control of production and distribution. Article 122 of the EU treaty allows the introduction of emergency measures when “severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products.” European Council President  Charles Michel  had touted the possibility of invoking Article 122 in January. An official familiar with the matter said then that the measures could help to get the bloc’s vaccination program back on track. “Vaccine production and vaccine deliveries in the EU must have a priority and I also want to discuss this whole picture with the heads of state and government,” von der Leyen said.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/eu-touts-use-of-emergency-powers-to-seize-vaccine-production,"[{'id': 'radio', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.44129554655870445, 'directScore': 0.44129554655870445}, {'id': '2432301', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.8148448043184885, 'directScore': 0.8148448043184885}, {'id': '0751538D:SW', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.6164642375168691, 'directScore': 0.6164642375168691}, {'id': 'AZN:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 1.4798920377867746, 'directScore': 1.4798920377867746}, {'id': '7535532Z:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 2.407557354925776, 'directScore': 2.407557354925776}, {'id': 'CL1:COM', 'type': 'Commodity', 'derivedScore': 0.8545209176788124, 'directScore': 0.8545209176788124}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5079622132253712, 'directScore': 0.5079622132253712}, {'id': 'drugs', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6380566801619433, 'directScore': 0.6380566801619433}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 2.1416329284750337}, {'id': 'exports', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.461673414304993, 'directScore': 3.461673414304993}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 5.966455235915582, 'directScore': 5.367611336032389}, {'id': 'FR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.5670715249662618, 'directScore': 0.5670715249662618}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.8545209176788124, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'GB', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 2.8623918864944353, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'energy', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.8545209176788124, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'industrials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.4798920377867746, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.5670692113496187, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'science', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'CH', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.6164642375168691, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'materials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.407557354925776, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'futures-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8545209176788124, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6164642375168691, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'commodity-futures', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8545209176788124, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'global-trade', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.461673414304993, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'UK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 2.8623918864944353, 'directScore': 0}]"
Airlines Get Glimpse of New Normal With EU’s Reopening Plan," Europe’s battered airlines and hospitality industry were promised a gradual return to a semblance of normalcy on Wednesday, with a plan to ease coronavirus-induced restrictions on travel. The  European Union ’s executive arm proposed the introduction of digital certificates that will offer proof their holders have been vaccinated, recovered from the illness or recently tested negative, and thus pose no significant health risks. The passes are meant to facilitate leisure trips both within the EU   the bloc, according to a   on Wednesday. The European Commission also unveiled a plan for a coordinated lifting of lockdowns. The  , which is explicitly meant to help restore tourism, will be based on a tier system “reflecting the epidemiological situation in each member state.” The effort is aimed at creating a unified policy as some tourism-dependent member states threaten to unilaterally reopen to outsiders. Even with wide agreement, it will take   the technology. The goal is to have the vaccine pass system in place by the middle of June, according to a draft copy of the proposal seen by Bloomberg. A gauge of European leisure and travel stocks has recouped the losses suffered at the start of the pandemic and is hovering around record highs, on the expectation that vaccine rollouts and a gradual easing of lockdowns will boost holiday bookings.   and   have both gained 11% this year. An   spokeswoman said in an email the carrier welcomes the vaccine certificates plan. “Given the continued progress of the vaccine roll-out we must ensure there is a risk-based and data-driven approach to removing restrictions, with the objective of returning to unrestricted travel where it is possible and safe to do so.” Adding to signs that the EU is shifting its focus on reopening, its leaders will declare next week that preparations should start “on a common approach to the gradual lifting of restrictions, to ensure that efforts are coordinated when the epidemiological situation allows for an easing of current measures,” according to a draft of their joint statement seen by Bloomberg. The wording contrasts sharply with their communique from last month, when EU leaders said that tight restrictions must be upheld. Still, the optimism that has buoyed travel stocks may be short-lived as projections show that air traffic and tourism are nowhere near their pre-pandemic levels. The pace of vaccinations in the EU lags behind both the U.S. and the U.K., the spread of infections shows little signs of abating, and officials in Brussels have warned that new strains of the coronavirus that are resistant to existing vaccines may emerge. Kristina Mamic, an official at the state-run Croatian Tourism Community, said that overnight stays this year are expected at 60% of their pre-crisis levels. “People are eager to travel and we see an interest in bookings, but ultimately it will depend on epidemiological situation,” she said. About 30% of hotels in Portugal won’t reopen for business in 2021 as bookings for the critical summer season remain weak, especially from foreign travelers, according to Portugal’s Hotel Association. “We thought the vaccine announcements would bolster reservations but there was no impact,” Cristina Siza Vieira, head of the hotel association, said during a webcast event on March 3. “It’s going to be a very poor year in terms of the offer of accommodation because there will be very little demand.” Reviving travel is crucial for airlines as well as tourism dependent southern European destinations such as Spain, Portugal and Greece, that have seen revenues wiped out after the Covid-19 pandemic decimated travel. The  International Air Transport Association  said that globally, airlines could burn through as much as $95 billion this year, almost double the industry body’s previous forecast, as new coronavirus strains lead governments to extend travel restrictions. While there’s evidence people want to travel, uncertainty about the rules has held back reservations. Airlines in Europe have been trying to stimulate demand by lowering ticket prices for travel in the second quarter of 2021, according to  Skytra , a unit of   which collates travel industry data. While tickets booked in advance are cheaper than last minute bookings, this year they are even more discounted than usual, Skytra said. British Airways  has been calling on the  U.K.  Government to allow the use of digital health passports to verify vaccination or negative test results. The carrier asked for vaccinated travelers to be allowed to fly without restrictions, while unvaccinated passengers could be allowed on planes with a negative Covid-19 test. “Vaccine passports and such like will at least enable people to travel if they want,” Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said in an email. “There is so much pent-up demand.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/airlines-get-glimpse-of-new-normal-as-eu-unveils-reopening-plan,"[{'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 5.9744789113562655, 'directScore': 4.0185404339250494}, {'id': 'AIR:FP', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.13471400394477318, 'directScore': 0.13471400394477318}, {'id': '280456Z:CN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.5715976331360947, 'directScore': 0.5715976331360947}, {'id': 'EZJ:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.6927021696252466, 'directScore': 0.6927021696252466}, {'id': 'IHG:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.7061143984220908, 'directScore': 0.7061143984220908}, {'id': 'LHA:GR', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.7112426035502959, 'directScore': 0.7112426035502959}, {'id': 'IAG:LN', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 5.264102564102564, 'directScore': 5.264102564102564}, {'id': 'GR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.25108481262327415, 'directScore': 0.25108481262327415}, {'id': 'ES', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.25483234714003944, 'directScore': 0.25483234714003944}, {'id': 'PT', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.9658777120315581, 'directScore': 0.9658777120315581}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0.0903353057199211}, {'id': 'policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8197238658777121, 'directScore': 0.8197238658777121}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9347140039447733, 'directScore': 0.9347140039447733}, {'id': 'stocks', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.270611439842209, 'directScore': 1.270611439842209}, {'id': 'airlines', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.528888503117298, 'directScore': 1.4879684418145955}, {'id': 'tourism', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.0532544378698225, 'directScore': 2.0532544378698225}, {'id': 'travel', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.934886615014112, 'directScore': 4.462524654832348}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.270611439842209, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.9347140039447733, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'luxury', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.4816247393178035, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'aerospace-industry', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.4816247393178035, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'CA', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.5715976331360947, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'DE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.7112426035502959, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'UK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 5.357028555153106, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 3.8729974343093287, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'GB', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 5.357028555153106, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'industrials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.3390590200726615, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'FR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.13471400394477318, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.25108481262327415, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.5715976331360947, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'well-spent', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'science', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.5, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'materials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.3390590200726615, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9374677421132085, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'transportation', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.528888503117298, 'directScore': 0}]"
Portugal Aims to Continue Protecting Jobs as Economy Reopens," Portugal will continue implementing measures to protect jobs as it eases confinement measures and tries to recover from the deepest slump in decades, Labor Minister  Ana Mendes Godinho  said. “Our top priority has been the protection of employment,” Mendes Godinho said in an interview. “We plan to continue to monitor and reinforce the measures that are needed to protect the income of families and jobs.” The government has paid part of the wages of workers who were put on furlough, offered training and provided grants and credit lines for companies. Portugal’s jobless rate rose to 6.8% in 2020, less than the government had forecast, while the  economy  shrank 7.6% as the outbreak hurt the country’s tourism industry and other businesses, the biggest contraction since at least 1960. For Portugal, which has the third-highest debt ratio in the euro area behind Greece and Italy, tourism represents about 15% of the economy and 9% of employment. Euro-area governments should be ready to keep up emergency support for their economies even after the worst of the coronavirus crisis is behind them, Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe   on Monday. The Portuguese government has spent about 3.1 billion euros ($3.7 billion) on extraordinary measures that aim to protect jobs and wages since the coronavirus pandemic started last year and authorities introduced confinement measures. Mendes Godinho said that about one fifth of the country’s workers have benefited from measures that aim to support jobs. “This is clearly an investment we’re doing to protect employment,” the minister said. “The alternative would be an increase in the unemployment rate along with a rise in the social costs of unemployment.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/portugal-aims-to-continue-protecting-jobs-as-economy-reopens,"[{'id': '21323410', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 2.332779065674649, 'directScore': 2.332779065674649}, {'id': 'EUR:CUR', 'type': 'Currency', 'derivedScore': 0.5248146035367941, 'directScore': 0.5248146035367941}, {'id': 'IT', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.5088419851682829, 'directScore': 0.5088419851682829}, {'id': 'GR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.5151169423844837, 'directScore': 0.5151169423844837}, {'id': 'PT', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 10.70907016543069, 'directScore': 10.70907016543069}, {'id': 'debt', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5350827153451226, 'directScore': 0.5350827153451226}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5955504848830576, 'directScore': 0.5955504848830576}, {'id': 'unemployment-rate', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7267541357672561, 'directScore': 0.7267541357672561}, {'id': 'tourism-industry', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.1112378779235597, 'directScore': 1.1112378779235597}, {'id': 'employment', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.426126640045636, 'directScore': 1.426126640045636}, {'id': 'labor', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.537343277785195, 'directScore': 1.537343277785195}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.7318881916714206, 'directScore': 1.7318881916714206}, {'id': 'jobs', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 7.672531486044189, 'directScore': 7.672531486044189}, {'id': 'travel', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.1112378779235597, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.7924544825380068, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.5350827153451226, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5350827153451226, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'bonds', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5350827153451226, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'tourism', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.1112378779235597, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 10.733546890980111, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'currency', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5248146035367941, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.5955504848830576, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5151169423844837, 'directScore': 0}]"
French Data Watchdog CNIL Opens Probe Into Clubhouse App," France’s data-protection watchdog said it’s opened a probe into private social media app  Clubhouse  following a complaint. French regulator CNIL said on Wednesday it questioned Alpha Exploration Co. Inc., the U.S. company behind the invite-only app, about the measures taken for the app to comply with  EU  rules on March 12. CNIL said the probe aims to confirm whether the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation applies to Clubhouse, even though it has no establishment in Europe. If so, the watchdog could make use of its sanctioning powers, it said. The probe follows   voiced by one of Germany’s most outspoken data protection regulators last month. The Hamburg data regulator asked the makers of the Clubhouse app for information about how they protect the privacy of European users and their contacts. Clubhouse users post off-the-cuff, informal conversations. It has become a popular platform, with about 5 million users by the end of January.

Key Ericsson Shareholder Reduces Stake to Free Up Capital," Cevian Capital AB  has cut its shareholding in  , in a move the activist investor says is designed to release capital for a new target. In the last 60 days, Stockholm-based Cevian sold 15 million shares, leaving it with a 4.94% stake in the Swedish phone network-equipment giant, the investor said in an email to Bloomberg. Shares in Ericsson fell as much as 2% on the news. “We have freed up capital for a new investment by adjusting the portfolio weight in Ericsson,”  Christer Gardell , managing partner at Cevian, said. “Ericsson has a lot more to offer and the company will continue to be one of our largest investments.” The decision to sell follows Ericsson’s 18% share-price gain this year, after the company managed to build 5G networks faster than expected, reaching profitability targets ahead of time. Ericsson currently has a market value of about $45 billion, compared with roughly $24 billion for Finnish rival  . “We expect Ericsson to continue to exceed market expectations, as evident in all quarters during 2020,” Gardell said. “We still believe that today’s valuation is far too low.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/key-ericsson-shareholder-reduces-stake-to-free-up-capital,"[{'id': '1521042', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.7124352331606217, 'directScore': 0.7124352331606217}, {'id': 'valuation', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.07858376511226252, 'directScore': 0.07858376511226252}, {'id': '5g-network', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.3747841105354059, 'directScore': 0.3747841105354059}, {'id': 'NOKIA:FH', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.21243523316062177, 'directScore': 0.21243523316062177}, {'id': 'ERICB:SS', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 10.653999668180198, 'directScore': 10.653999668180198}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 10.656117592419617, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'FI', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.21243523316062177, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'utilities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 10.656117592419617, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 10.656117592419617, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'SE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 10.653999668180198, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'technology', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 10.656117592419617, 'directScore': 0}]"
Pinduoduo Billionaire Exits Board After Firm Surpasses Alibaba," ’s billionaire chairman has stepped down from the board, relinquishing control of China’s fastest-growing e-commerce company the same day it announced its user base had surpassed Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s. Founder  Colin Huang  will be replaced by Lei Chen, who keeps his chief executive officer title, the company said in a statement Wednesday. The move cements Huang’s retreat from the corporation that has helped him become China’s third-richest man, after he handed over the role of CEO last year. Huang is leaving as its growth sets records. Sales in the December quarter climbed 146% to 26.5 billion yuan ($4.1 billion), beating the average 19.3 billion yuan forecast of analysts. Its revenue is growing at several-fold the pace of e-commerce rivals   and  , fueled by surging demand for online groceries and as more shoppers in less-developed cities venture online. Pinduoduo is   become the world’s largest grocer, Chen said. To achieve that target, the company intends to invest in an agriculture-focused logistics infrastructure platform over the next few years. After stepping down from the role of chairman, Huang will give up the 1:10 super voting rights attached to his shares in Pinduoduo. He’s also pledged to extend the lock-up period for his shares by another three years, according to a statement by the company. The stock slid more than 5% in pre-market trading in New York. His departure caps a rise meteoric even by Chinese internet industry standards, creating a $57 billion personal fortune and a $200 billion U.S.-listed company in a span of about six years with the help of heavy advertising. Pinduoduo’s stock rose more than fourfold last year and reached a record on Feb. 17, though the shares have since retraced after a wider technology selloff and China’s scrutiny of its internet companies.

In 2017, the billionaire said he was unlikely to spend the rest of his life at PDD, saying in a letter to employees he wanted to delegate more responsibility to younger colleagues to keep its entrepreneurial spirit alive. Pinduduo’s annual active consumers climbed to 788 million in December, surpassing the 779 million users at Alibaba’s online marketplaces. During the recent Spring Festival holiday, daily users at Pinduoduo briefly   those on the Taobao mobile app, according to researcher QuestMobile, underlining how the company has narrowed the gap with its larger rival. Net loss attributable to shareholders in the December quarter narrowed to 1.38 billion yuan from 1.75 billion a year earlier, Pinduoduo said in a statement on Wednesday before the U.S. market open. Gross merchandise value in the 12 months ended December rose 66% to 1.67 trillion yuan. That growth has come with a price, however. The company faced an online backlash earlier this year after an employee in her early 20s died after walking home at 1:30 a.m. and another committed suicide.

Delta Joins Foxconn in Betting on Electric-Car Riches,"  predicted rapid growth at its fledgling electric-vehicle component business for this year and beyond, joining a bandwagon of Taiwanese suppliers bulking up their automotive muscles as tech giants including   venture into the car market. “Our EV-related business will grow at least at a double-digit rate over the next few years,” Delta Chairman  Yancey Hai  said in an interview on Wednesday. “We will further integrate our existing power products into modules and optimize them to make it easier for EV makers to build their vehicles.” Automotive customers accounted for a small fraction of Delta’s revenue in 2020, but are becoming increasingly important for growth. Delta and peers including Foxconn Technology Group are betting on electric cars as the next big thing as demand for PCs and  , the main products that the Taiwanese suppliers have long depended on, is hitting a plateau. A longtime power-product supplier to Apple,   and other global tech companies, Delta started to build its EV-component business more than a decade ago. It now supplies power products or powertrains to  ,  ,   and other major carmakers. Chief Executive Officer  Cheng Ping  told reporters Wednesday its goal is to grab at least 10% of a $33 billion combined market for EV power and traction products in 2030. Technology companies plotting forays into the EV business could provide an opening for their current suppliers. Apple has a team of engineers working on drive systems and vehicle designs, though its autonomous, electric auto is at least  , people familiar with the matter have said. The U.S. company has said little about the project. Hai said global chip shortages won’t affect the company’s existing EV-related contracts as it has placed sufficient orders for semiconductors. EV makers whose sales are growing faster than expected will struggle to get enough chips to fulfill orders, he said. Sales at Delta’s in-vehicle component business increased 70% to 80% last year from about NT$5 billion ($177 million) in 2019, Wang Wen-wen, an analyst at JihSun Securities Investment Consulting, wrote in a Feb. 26 note. The business is still losing money but is set to break even within two years, Wang wrote. “The business will continue to grow significantly in 2021 with the launch of new EV models,” the analyst wrote. Demand for notebook computers, servers and EVs helped Delta boost sales 5.4% last year to a record NT$282.6 billion, while net income rose 10% to NT$25.5 billion.   of the company more than doubled over the past 12 months. Delta will also seek growth by investing in local companies specialized in software and mechanical parts for EVs to complement its power-focused business, Hai said. As part of its sustainability efforts, Delta is striving to have all manufacturing sites and offices use 100% renewable energy and reach carbon neutrality by 2030 following its recent entry into the global   initiative. Delta is considering building and operating its own solar power plant in India, spokesman Jesse Chou told reporters on Wednesday.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/taiwan-s-delta-joins-foxconn-in-betting-on-electric-car-riches,"[{'id': 'STLA:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.606313834726091, 'directScore': 0.606313834726091}, {'id': 'GM:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.6121943670690189, 'directScore': 0.6121943670690189}, {'id': 'TSLA:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.6155988857938719, 'directScore': 0.6155988857938719}, {'id': 'DELL:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.6703806870937791, 'directScore': 0.6703806870937791}, {'id': 'AAPL:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 2.5471468463863065, 'directScore': 2.5471468463863065}, {'id': '2308:TT', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 12.9702878365831, 'directScore': 12.9702878365831}, {'id': 'wisconsin', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.6957598266790468, 'directScore': 0.6957598266790468}, {'id': 'renewable-energy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.0748994119467657, 'directScore': 0.0748994119467657}, {'id': 'software', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.13556174558960074, 'directScore': 0.13556174558960074}, {'id': 'investing', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.14917982048901268, 'directScore': 0.14917982048901268}, {'id': 'smartphone', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7347570411637264, 'directScore': 0.7347570411637264}, {'id': 'automotive', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.8756359564471987, 'directScore': 1.8756359564471987}, {'id': 'electric-vehicles', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.0594243268337977, 'directScore': 2.0594243268337977}, {'id': '18452666', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.012070566388115135, 'directScore': 0.012070566388115135}, {'id': '5017577', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.5861962240792324, 'directScore': 0.5861962240792324}, {'id': 'IN', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.017022593624264934, 'directScore': 0.017022593624264934}, {'id': 'MX', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.6988548437016403, 'directScore': 0.6988548437016403}, {'id': 'utilities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 13.169830120438647, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg-concerns', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.0748994119467657, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 12.980165807521935, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 12.970299007063561, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 13.303617811753515, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 2.9500055957872653, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'mobile-phones', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.653121872974506, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'brics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.017022593624264934, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'climate-change', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.0748994119467657, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.0748994119467657, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'consumer-discretionary', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.2185735955057053, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'emerging-markets-economics', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.0748994119467657, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 2.8549647398871407, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'transportation', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.8756359564471987, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'technology', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 13.17137781595588, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'TW', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 12.9702878365831, 'directScore': 0}]"
Uber’s U.K. Defeat Won’t Be Blueprint for Global Labor Fight," For years,   has been locked in a fierce and expensive contest with global regulators over the protections it offers to drivers. The gig economy giant has argued that drivers are free agents, able to work when and where they like, and are therefore not directly employed by Uber -- or eligible for benefits like sick leave and overtime. In its home state of California, Uber Chief Executive Officer  Dara Khosrowshahi  advocated for a “third way” of classifying workers -- other than as contractors or as full-time staff. And he’s suggested that the company’s approach in the state could be a blueprint for resolving similar labor battles brewing worldwide. But on Tuesday, Uber said it would adopt a different model for its drivers in the U.K. After losing a watershed ruling in Britain’s Supreme Court, the company agreed to reclassify all of its 70,000 drivers in the country as “workers,” which are guaranteed specific benefits under U.K. law. The result is essentially a “fourth way” for Uber -- and another example of the growing pressure the company is facing from world governments to treat its workers better and comply with with local rules. “Some countries have strong labor laws and some have none at all. We are all starting at different points,” said Vanessa Bain, co-founder of worker advocacy group Gig Workers Collective. “The complexities of different legal systems continue to be a challenge for both the workers that are organizing and for the companies.” Uber shares were down about 4% in the first hour of trading in New York on Wednesday. In the U.K., drivers will now be entitled to the minimum wage, vacation pay and a pension. Drivers in the country had already been getting health benefits since 2018 and will continue to get sickness, injury and parental leave as workers. Maria Figueroa, director of labor and policy research at Cornell University’s Worker Institute, said that while the new benefits are a step in the right direction, many will argue they don’t go far enough because Uber will still function as an employer without the same responsibilities. Regardless of the limitations, Figueroa said, “advocates in some countries will go for it” because they see it as the first in a series of steps required to win more protections for the world’s fast-growing population of gig workers. “To engage in a fight for full benefits is a long and winding road,” Figueroa said. “A lot of advocates are re-evaluating whether they want to do that.” In California, Uber and other gig economy companies effectively overturned a law last year that required them to classify their workers as employees. The company wrote and bankrolled a ballot proposal in the November election that overrode the law, but granted workers a few perks including a wage floor, a health insurance stipend and some mileage reimbursement. The proposal, sponsored by the country’s largest gig companies, was the most expensive measure in state history. Under the new rules in both California and the U.K., drivers will only be paid for the time they engage in a ride, and wages won’t cover time spent waiting for a passenger -- hours that account for roughly one-third of drivers’ workdays on average, according to a study by the University of California, Berkeley. Figueroa said the benefits offered in the U.K. for workers are similar to those required by Canada’s “dependent worker” category. And while she said that advocates in many countries wouldn’t be satisfied with the company’s U.K. policy, some of them might lobby for similar protections in their own markets. “Even the unions and the workers who won the ruling will tell you this isn’t enough, but it’s what we got now,” she said. The drivers who first brought the U.K. case against Uber say the company hasn’t gone far enough. Uber said drivers will be entitled to minumum wage after its accepted a trip from a customer, but the Supreme Court said drivers are working whenever they’re logged into the app. “While Uber undoubtedly has made progress here, we cannot accept anything less than full complience with legal minimums,” drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam said in a statement. Farrar said on Twitter that they expect to be back in court against Uber. The rights of gig workers and their employment classification is likely to remain a major flash point in the months and years to come. That will be particularly true as drivers return to work after the pandemic and companies increasingly face different pressures in different regions. For example, in New York, a proposal to allow gig workers to form unions and collectively bargain could be introduced this spring. In Seattle, the focus is on extending a pandemic hazard pay increase for grocery store employees to people in other jobs. And the cities of San Francisco and Oakland, California last year passed laws giving gig workers   80 hours of paid sick leave during the pandemic. “There’s no one path to get to where we need to go,” Bain said. “There are differences even among cities. It’s a complicated system.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/uber-s-u-k-defeat-won-t-be-blueprint-for-global-labor-battles,"[{'id': 'supreme-court', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 1.9295228460630587, 'directScore': 1.9295228460630587}, {'id': 'TWTR:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.3481706288990052, 'directScore': 0.3481706288990052}, {'id': 'UBER:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 18.169560110765328, 'directScore': 18.169560110765328}, {'id': 'new-york', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.8020569887034227, 'directScore': 0.8020569887034227}, {'id': 'california', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 2.2962400944191534, 'directScore': 2.2962400944191534}, {'id': 'oakland', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.0409711684370258, 'directScore': 0.0409711684370258}, {'id': 'san-francisco', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.04400606980273141, 'directScore': 0.04400606980273141}, {'id': 'seattle', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.06693643567695161, 'directScore': 0.06693643567695161}, {'id': 'jobs', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.048052604957005564, 'directScore': 0.048052604957005564}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.05142471758556736, 'directScore': 0.05142471758556736}, {'id': 'employment', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.1310065756196257, 'directScore': 0.1310065756196257}, {'id': 'labor-laws', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8098128477491148, 'directScore': 0.8098128477491148}, {'id': 'policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9824650143314786, 'directScore': 0.9824650143314786}, {'id': 'travel', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.489124936772888, 'directScore': 1.489124936772888}, {'id': 'law', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.885688505309604, 'directScore': 1.9067610858202664}, {'id': 'minimum-wage', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.2643736300792447, 'directScore': 2.2643736300792447}, {'id': 'labor', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.518441240937447, 'directScore': 4.518441240937447}, {'id': '16842259', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.6189512729725173, 'directScore': 0.6189512729725173}, {'id': '2037795', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.9300286629573428, 'directScore': 0.9300286629573428}, {'id': 'CA', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.3392345304333165, 'directScore': 0.3392345304333165}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.9824650143314786, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'industrials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 18.169560110765328, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'esg-concerns', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.2643736300792447, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 18.176061724593566, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 18.17289598643015, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'technology', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.3481706288990052, 'directScore': 0}]"
"Bill Gross Surprises With Short Bets on Treasuries, GameStop"," Onetime bond king  Bill Gross  has been busy in retirement, shorting Treasury bonds, playing chicken with day traders on Reddit and even making a bundle on energy prices. The Pacific Investment Management Co. co-founder, who runs money for his charitable foundation, shared some of his trades in an interview Tuesday on Bloomberg Television. Gross said he bet against the  10-year Treasury  through the futures market and remains short, anticipating a combination of rising commodity prices, a weaker dollar and stimulus-driven demand will spark inflation. “Inflation, currently below 2%, is not going to be below 2% in the next few months,” Gross said. “I see a 3% to 4% number ahead of us.” Treasuries are familiar territory for Gross, 76, who once managed the world’s biggest bond fund. The other wagers are more esoteric, though consistent with the kind of investing he did after leaving Pimco in 2014 following a feud with his partners. Running the Janus Unconstrained Fund until retirement in 2019, Gross often sold volatility, seeking to make money on mispriced options. That’s what drew him to the January frenzy in GameStop Corp. He described selling call options on GameStop, initially at strike prices of $150 and $200, and losing $10 million as retail buying on Robinhood Markets helped drive the stock to almost $400. Gross refused to fold and said he managed to book a profit of about $10 million after exiting the trade when the shares finally tumbled. Now he’s back in, selling call options at $250 and $300, meaning he could face losses if the stock, now trading close to $210, surpasses those levels. “The volatility is super high,” he said. “I think this is a perfect opportunity for options sellers, not buyers.“ Gross said he entered his wager against the 10-year Treasury when the yield, now about 1.6%, was about 35 basis points lower. Like others who have grown increasingly bearish on bonds, he predicts pressure on prices to rise as the recently passed $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill finds its way into an economy already primed to accelerate. “There’s significant demand that is stored up, power that is stored up that can be unleashed if consumers want to go in that direction, and I think to a certain extent they will,” Gross said. One market proxy for inflation, the 10-year   inflation rate, climbed on Tuesday to the highest since January 2014. Gross   that commodity prices have surged by almost 40% since bottoming last April. The Federal Open Market Committee is all but certain to hold interest rates near zero at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Federal Reserve Chairman  Jay Powell , meanwhile, has promised to ignore spikes in inflation until the central bank determines that its revised targets for price stability and employment are met. Gross isn’t sure he’ll have the necessary patience though. Not since the 1960s has the Fed let inflation run deliberately “hot.” “Three to six to 12 months at 3% to 4% plus inflation will give him pause in terms of his current policy,” Gross said. Throughout the pandemic, investors desperate for yield have been prospecting in unconventional places. For Gross, one such adventure was natural-gas pipelines. He said he bought some master limited partnership units last year, attracted by tax advantages and yields of 13% to 14%. Gross was also encouraged that  Warren Buffett  was making a similar bet.

Where Can You Take Home the Most Pay After Taxes?," For the traders and bankers who had a hyper-lucrative pandemic, the other shoe could be dropping soon. Their pay packets represent an inviting target for government officials around the world conjuring a solution to the trillions of debt they added in the past year. For instance: Now that President Joe Biden has passed his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus act, he is said to be planning to pay for his long-term economic program with  . Earlier this month, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak rolled out a budget that will take taxes to their highest level since the 1960s (even though income taxes won’t go up).  “Are people concerned? Of course,” says Benedikte Malling Bech, director of North Star Law, a London-based boutique law firm that advises international and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. “Every government is going to have a financial struggle. What people are watching with great interest is how are different countries going to be able to cope with it.” If keeping and attracting skilled workers and their employers are vital to a nation’s economic recovery, deciding how the bill is paid — and by whom — will be a delicate task for policy makers. As data calculated by PwC U.K., the U.K. arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, for Bloomberg News shows, some will have more room to maneuver than others. Highly paid British workers, for instance, actually take home less pay than their counterparts in either Germany or Spain. That may jar with some Brexit supporters who’d hoped to create a low-tax “Singapore-on-Thames” following its break from the European Union. “It would be difficult to have a very low personal tax rate in the U.K., to dismantle key, politically accepted parts of the state like pensions, universal health care, and good education,” says Iain McCluskey, a PwC partner who specializes in personal tax.  Looking to the other side of the Atlantic, the findings also illustrate one reason why Wall Streeters have been migrating from high-tax states like New York and California to lower-tax jurisdictions like Florida. A Florida resident earning 500,000 pounds ($695,250)  a year gets to keep 354,426 pounds, compared with 299,474 pounds for a New Yorker and 312,690 pounds for a Californian.  PwC’s data do not take into account short-term programs that temporarily reduce taxes for expatriates. ( , for instance, has special income-tax exemptions for some foreign workers, intended to attract company directors and other global talent.   also lets some expats avoid paying taxes on 30% of their salary.) According to McCluskey, these policies are politically contentious, particularly during recessions. And they are time limited. What’s more, the global trend has been towards shorter, more restrictive allowances.  While lockdowns are only slowly being lifted, tax proposals are already in the air. In addition to Biden’s plans, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has introduced legislation calling for a wealth tax (though its passage seems unlikely). And last month in Hong Kong, the government upped its levy on stock trading for the first time since 1993 (but authorities are still trying to keep up the territory’s reputation as a global financial hub despite a recent Chinese crackdown). The tax data don’t take into account housing costs, access to public transportation or purchasing power parity. Public services are harder to quantify than than the numbers on the bottom of their payslip. As governments plot their post-pandemic fiscal policy, high earners are watching carefully.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/places-with-the-highest-and-lowest-income-tax-rate-and-take-home-salary,"[{'id': 'frankfurt', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.12266608771168042, 'directScore': 0.12266608771168042}, {'id': 'new-york-city', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.1717325227963526, 'directScore': 0.1717325227963526}, {'id': '13387985', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 1.2959183673469388, 'directScore': 1.2959183673469388}, {'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 1.6364094398547715, 'directScore': 0.6376465479808945}, {'id': 'california', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.606600086843248, 'directScore': 0.606600086843248}, {'id': 'new-york', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.7863656100738168, 'directScore': 0.7863656100738168}, {'id': 'florida', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 1.1339557099435518, 'directScore': 1.1339557099435518}, {'id': '10182Z:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.7283977420755536, 'directScore': 0.7283977420755536}, {'id': 'PT', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.084020842379505, 'directScore': 0.084020842379505}, {'id': 'IT', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.21146330872774644, 'directScore': 0.21146330872774644}, {'id': 'HK', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.32783326096396004, 'directScore': 0.32783326096396004}, {'id': 'NL', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.538862353452019, 'directScore': 0.538862353452019}, {'id': 'FR', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.6191923577941815, 'directScore': 0.6191923577941815}, {'id': 'ES', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.742509769865393, 'directScore': 0.742509769865393}, {'id': 'DE', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.8006947459834998, 'directScore': 0.8006947459834998}, {'id': 'transportation', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.2653061224489796, 'directScore': 0.2653061224489796}, {'id': 'stock-trading', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.3184976118106817, 'directScore': 0.3184976118106817}, {'id': 'wealth', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.3417281806339557, 'directScore': 0.3417281806339557}, {'id': 'education', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.5966131133304385, 'directScore': 0.5966131133304385}, {'id': 'brexit', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.659140251845419, 'directScore': 0.659140251845419}, {'id': 'policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.41027401704384, 'directScore': 0.9676508901432913}, {'id': 'law', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.6695614415979159, 'directScore': 1.6695614415979159}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 2.1061658706035606}, {'id': 'taxes', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.6465479808944856, 'directScore': 2.6465479808944856}, {'id': 'debt', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.402402768841657, 'directScore': 3.402402768841657}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.5771209244685607, 'directScore': 3.5771209244685607}, {'id': 'tax-rate', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 8.310365487580821, 'directScore': 8.310365487580821}, {'id': 'politics', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 2.9124087591240877, 'directScore': 2.9124087591240877}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 3.4173099881835403, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'monetary-policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.925531914893617, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'tax-reform', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 8.310365487580821, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 3.5771209244685607, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.2653061224489796, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'bonds', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.402402768841657, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'megacity', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.1717325227963526, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 0.7283977420755536, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'personal-finance', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 3.6033992040119007, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'Asia', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.32783326096396004, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.7283977420755536, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'well-spent', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.528285767370117, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'materials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7283977420755536, 'directScore': 0}]"
Bargain Hunters Score in San Francisco as Cheaper Rents Linger," The crash is over in America’s hardest-hit rental market, but cheaper housing may be around for a long time to come. After an exodus of residents during the pandemic, San Francisco is starting to see people trickle back as the economy gradually reopens. They’re moving into buildings that had lost tenants for months, pushing rents higher for the first time since the lockdowns took hold last spring. The boom times are far from back, though. Many of the tech companies that turbocharged San Francisco’s economy are embracing permanent remote work, giving their highly-paid employees less incentive to lease pricey studios and one-bedrooms near the office. The result is that apartment owners have lost the pricing power they once had in a city known for its high housing costs and gaping inequality. “It’s going to take years for the average landlord’s revenue to get back to pre-Covid levels,” said John Pawlowski, an analyst at real estate data and research firm Green Street. The drop in rents means that higher-end apartment buildings in the city are now worth at least 20% less than before the pandemic, he said. Landlords have already taken large hits. Revenue at San Francisco buildings owned by  Essex Property Trust Inc. , one of the largest West Coast apartment owners, fell 17% in 2020, the most of any of the company’s California markets. Related Cos. has resorted to incentives like   and   gift cards to woo tenants to its luxury high rises. Parkmerced, San Francisco's largest apartment complex with more than 3,200 units, is offering   with $5 deposits and $5 for monthly parking while waiving fees for pets and applications. Parkmerced's vacancy rate climbed to 25% last year from 6% in 2019 when $1.56 billion in mortgages were issued for the property, according to information compiled by the  loan 's trustees. It’s a similar trend that’s playing out in pricey cities such as  , and the effects are even more pronounced. San Francisco suffered the greatest increase in net population outflows from its urban neighborhoods last year among large U.S. metropolitan areas, according to   from the Cleveland Fed. That was both due to people leaving and because the pandemic stymied the typical inflow of young people moving to the city for new jobs and higher education. Ironically, it was San Francisco’s locally-grown tech industry that enabled remote work and the mass departures. After the pandemic silenced the sports venues, nightlife and food scene, paying high rents didn’t seem worthwhile. Now, after one of the nation’s strictest lockdowns, indoor restaurants, cafes and museums were permitted this month to reopen with restrictions. As vaccines bring the promise of a return to normal life, rents have stopped spiraling downward. They bottomed out in January 27% below their level at the start of the pandemic, according to data from Apartment List. In February, the average-one bedroom rent rose 1%, the first month-over-month gain in a year, to just over $2,000 a month. “It’s a turning point,” said Igor Popov, the chief economist at Apartment List. “People are moving back in, but we’re not jumping back to pre-Covid rents because the group occupying those units are different and have different price points.” Lindsay Albert, a director of programming for an arts organization in San Francisco, was among them. She left the city last April because she felt uncomfortable living with roommates in a pandemic. After spending eight months in Tomales, a rural hamlet north of the city, Albert returned at the end of last year and began renting a one-bedroom in the inner Richmond district for $2,000 a month in January. It’s more than she was paying to live in a group house at the start of the pandemic, but about $1,000 less than the one-bedroom units she was looking at a year ago. “I feel like I’ve won the lottery,” she said as she rattled off the amenities, including a living area big enough to fit a six-foot table and a couch with a chaise, as well as proximity to Golden Gate Park and the Presidio. “I’m 34 years old and I haven’t ever been able to live alone.” The broader return of residents, and rents, depends on the pace of vaccinations and reopenings, Popov said. “There’s a lot of latent demand for urban amenities,” he said. “People really want to go to restaurants and bars and concerts.” Outdoor dining has revived street life in residential neighborhoods like Nob Hill, Hayes Valley, the Mission District and Valencia Corridor. On weekends in the Marina District, Steiner Street closes to cars and fills with diners feasting on calamari, sourdough bread, craft beer and Napa chardonnay. “They have that life and vitality not too dissimilar to what they were pre-Covid,” said Miles Garber, vice president of research with real estate marketing company Polaris Pacific in San Francisco. “While things have improved recently, there’s still a long ways to go.” Some of Garber’s friends who worked remotely from places like Utah’s ski resorts or Hawaii’s beaches are moving back in anticipation of being required to report to office desks. Other friends left permanently, accelerating long-planned moves to single-family homes in the suburbs where they can raise a family. “Instead of moving two years from now, it became two months,” Garber said. He took advantage of lower prices to relocate from a studio to a one-bedroom apartment in Nob Hill for $2,500 a month -- a roughly $600 post-Covid discount. The recovery seems to be fueled, in part, by San Franciscans bent on reviving its place as an arts and counter-culture mecca after the last decade’s big-dollar tech dominance. That may imply longer-term pain for luxury buildings designed to appeal to young knowledge-industry workers. Developers of more affordable projects are forging ahead. Builders Urban Land Development and DM Development received planning commission approval this month for an apartment building in the Mission District. The 168-unit project includes 23 reserved for below-market rentals and a ground floor dedicated to community art space. Before the pandemic, San Francisco faced a shortage of almost 24,000 affordable units for low income renters, according to the California Housing Partnership, a deficit that falling prices on high-end apartments may not dent at all. “We’re in such a hole,” DM Chief Executive Officer Mark MacDonald said. “We’re not going to catch up in our lifetime.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/cheap-rents-in-san-francisco-lure-bargain-hunters-after-27-plunge,"[{'id': '0210055D:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.0327474838515848, 'directScore': 0.0327474838515848}, {'id': 'MA:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.7713684843022383, 'directScore': 0.7713684843022383}, {'id': 'ESS:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.804416403785489, 'directScore': 0.804416403785489}, {'id': 'hawaii', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.21075559561363977, 'directScore': 0.21075559561363977}, {'id': 'utah', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.21406038756196485, 'directScore': 0.21406038756196485}, {'id': 'new-york', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.6946071804115969, 'directScore': 0.6946071804115969}, {'id': 'california', 'type': 'Location', 'derivedScore': 0.7860898302538681, 'directScore': 0.7860898302538681}, {'id': 'cleveland', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.6602073005858495, 'directScore': 0.6602073005858495}, {'id': 'richmond', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 1.2592759501276851, 'directScore': 1.2592759501276851}, {'id': 'san-francisco', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 9.232150079153234, 'directScore': 9.232150079153234}, {'id': 'art', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.0530268889890341, 'directScore': 0.0530268889890341}, {'id': 'beer', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.2765509989484753, 'directScore': 0.2765509989484753}, {'id': 'automotive', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.2870662460567823, 'directScore': 0.2870662460567823}, {'id': 'food', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.608532371939312, 'directScore': 0.608532371939312}, {'id': 'sports', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6127384707826348, 'directScore': 0.6127384707826348}, {'id': 'education', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6358720144209103, 'directScore': 0.6358720144209103}, {'id': 'jobs', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.6382754994742377, 'directScore': 0.6382754994742377}, {'id': 'mortgages', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7195433378398678, 'directScore': 0.7195433378398678}, {'id': 'equality', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.882529668018627, 'directScore': 0.882529668018627}, {'id': 'real-estate', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.1149166291122128, 'directScore': 1.1149166291122128}, {'id': 'cities', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.272410126262027, 'directScore': 4.272410126262027}, {'id': '20813007', 'type': 'Person', 'derivedScore': 0.009764158029142257, 'directScore': 0.009764158029142257}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 1.2854147337168307, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 6, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.804416403785489, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'alternative-investments', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.0530268889890341, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'luxury', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.0530268889890341, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'infrastructure', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.151873217377809, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 1.0053703149679079, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'well-spent', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7195433378398678, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'materials', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.0327474838515848, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'software-company', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.7713684843022383, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 1.0053703149679079, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'transportation', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.2870662460567823, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'personal-finance', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 2.427603690218003, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'technology', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.7713684843022383, 'directScore': 0}]"
Inflation Is Just a Monster Under the Bed for Investors," Economic recoveries are supposed to be a time of celebration for investors, and the recovery from Covid-19 now underway should be no different. The economy is growing again; business activity is picking up; deflation is a distant threat; cheap money is goosing the recovery; and stocks are surging on hopes of higher profits. And yet, rather than cheer their good fortune, many investors appear to be tormented by the recovery’s potential pitfalls. One of the most feared scenarios is that inflation will  , pushing interest rates higher and tanking the stock market. While it can’t be ruled out of hand, there’s little indication that a worrisome jump in inflation is coming. Sure, in theory, the table is set for higher prices. Supply lines are  . Congress and the Federal Reserve have   about $9 trillion to fight the pandemic, the largest stimulus and relief effort in history. And the personal saving   has never been higher, so those who have prospered during this pandemic have money to spend. If inflation picks up, higher interest rates and lower stock prices could follow. Inflation and interest rates moved in   during the 1970s, the last time the U.S. experienced a surge in prices. Also, the U.S. stock market is priced for perfection, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio only slightly below the peak of the dot-com bubble, so it’s vulnerable to bad news.  That may explain the nervous gasps in response to recent market moves. The 10-year breakeven rate, a widely cited gauge of expected inflation that tracks the difference in yield between nominal and inflation-protected Treasuries,   modestly above the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2% recently, up from about 0.5% last March. Seemingly on cue, the yield on 10-year Treasuries   to 1.6% from 1% roughly a month ago. At the same time, once unshakable tech-related stocks have taken a small dive. The venerable NYSE Fang+ Index is down about 9%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index is off roughly 4% since mid-February. Pull back the lens, though, and those moves look benign. Consider, for example, that annual inflation has averaged 2.2% since 1871, according to numbers compiled by Yale professor Robert Shiller. In that light, the breakeven rate appears merely to have inched closer to the long-term inflation rate, which seems appropriate given that the economy is returning to normal, too. Meanwhile, the yield on 10-year Treasuries has averaged 4.5% over the last 150 years, so even after its recent move higher, the 10-year yield is still shockingly low.  There’s not much to see in the stock market, either. While big tech shares  and growth stocks more generally have stumbled, the broader market hasn’t moved. The Russell 1000 Index is little changed from its high on Feb. 12. And some stocks are surging — the Russell 1000 Value Index is up 5% over the same time. That divergence between growth and value is more likely driven by valuations than modestly higher interest rates. There’s been no   in the past between the level of interest rates and the valuation gap between growth and value stocks. But notably, the gap was among the highest ever recorded last year, so it was  . In any event, it hasn’t narrowed much. In other words, despite all the fuss about inflation expectations, interest rates and stocks, little has happened so far. That’s important for investors to keep in mind because there’s no shortage of hucksters eager to sell them all sorts of expensive and unnecessary portfolio “insurance” against the coming scourge of inflation and resulting market turmoil. Amid the flurry of slick sales talk, it’s easy to forget that a simple, balanced, low-cost   of stocks and bonds has served investors well in the past and has more than kept pace with inflation over time, even during the 1970s. To that end, investors who have binged on U.S. growth stocks and long-term bonds in recent years can strike a better balance by shortening the maturity of their bonds and expanding their stock portfolio, both within the U.S. and  . If the 1970s is any guide, investors will have plenty of warning that inflation is moving in a worrisome direction. Inflation began to tick up long before reaching its twin peaks of 12.2% and 14.6% in 1974 and 1980, respectively. It first edged higher in 1966, doubling to 3.8% in October from 1.9% in January. After declining for several months, it gradually resumed its climb to 6.4% in early 1970. Those warning shots didn’t signal that higher inflation was sure to follow, obviously, but they alerted investors that inflationary forces were afoot. There is   going on today. The inflation rate was 1.7% in February, up from a dangerously low 0.2% last May but still well below the Fed’s target.  Another difference between the years leading up to the 1970s and today is that the Fed — indeed everyone — is on guard for a replay of that fearsome episode. Last time, the Fed didn’t   until the late 1970s, more than a decade after inflation reared its head. It’s not likely to   the policy curve again, to paraphrase Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed. Inflation may yet become a problem, but that’s far from obvious. Keep an eye on the monthly numbers. If annual inflation rises meaningfully higher than its long-term average for several months, it may be a sign that inflationary pressures are building. Until then, the fear of inflation is a greater threat to investors than inflation itself.  To contact the author of this story:  at  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  at ",https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-17/personal-finance-investors-need-not-fear-inflation-bogeyman,"[{'id': 'san-francisco', 'type': 'City', 'derivedScore': 0.06544454628780935, 'directScore': 0.06544454628780935}, {'id': 'federal-reserve', 'type': 'Organization', 'derivedScore': 1.9099908340971588, 'directScore': 1.9099908340971588}, {'id': 'AONE:US', 'type': 'Company', 'derivedScore': 0.9191567369385885, 'directScore': 0.9191567369385885}, {'id': 'policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.1706243278697, 'directScore': 0.0764436296975252}, {'id': 'valuation', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.4439963336388634, 'directScore': 0.4439963336388634}, {'id': 'congress', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.862878093492209, 'directScore': 0.862878093492209}, {'id': 'bonds', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.8914757103574703, 'directScore': 0.8914757103574703}, {'id': 'coronavirus', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 0.982218148487626, 'directScore': 0.982218148487626}, {'id': 'interest-rates', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 3.8214482126489457, 'directScore': 3.8214482126489457}, {'id': 'stocks', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.0795600366636116, 'directScore': 4.0795600366636116}, {'id': 'personal-finance', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.834463794683776, 'directScore': 5.834463794683776}, {'id': 'RIY:IND', 'type': 'Index', 'derivedScore': 2.773968835930339, 'directScore': 2.773968835930339}, {'id': 'markets', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 5.230375544354642, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'finance', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 4.6451045838548035, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'monetary-policy', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.317294105532141, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'government', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.887129329927085, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'central-bankers', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.9099908340971588, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'healthcare', 'type': 'Classification', 'derivedScore': 0.982218148487626, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 2.9262504867038683, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'well-spent', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 5.834463794683776, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'fixed-income', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 4.400753792839691, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'banking', 'type': 'Topic', 'derivedScore': 1.9099908340971588, 'directScore': 0}, {'id': 'US', 'type': 'Country', 'derivedScore': 2.9262504867038683, 'directScore': 0}]"
He Downgraded the U.S. a Decade Ago. He Stands By It.," No company or government likes a credit downgrade. Analysts might brace themselves for bitter phone calls or public rebukes of their analysis. It comes with the job. John Chambers found out it’s a whole different ballgame when it comes to rating the U.S. After he and his colleague David Beers at S&P Global Ratings   the U.S. of its AAA grade in August 2011, dropping it one level to AA+ for the first time in history, he says it wasn’t long before he received death threats. Chambers hired a bodyguard for a few weeks after the New York Post published a piece that attacked his credentials: “The Wall Street bean counter who trashed America’s global credit reputation is a New Yorker who never studied economics, majored in literature and philosophy, and has a master’s in English lit.” He discovered someone hacked his email and tried to drain his brokerage account. All for a downgrade that ultimately had no long-term consequences whatsoever. Of course, S&P also received the typical backlash. U.S. officials were quick to cite a   that meant the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio would be lower than S&P’s projection of 85% in 2021. In hindsight, it was too low either way: The U.S. gross debt position as a percentage of GDP is more than 130%, according to the International Monetary Fund, and is only set to increase after the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act. Chambers, the former chairman of S&P’s sovereign rating committee, comes off as neither a staunch deficit hawk nor a believer in Modern Monetary Theory. Rather, he says the Washington dysfunction that inspired the 2011 downgrade hasn’t improved much over the past decade, leading to inequality and an economy running below its potential. I spoke with Chambers by phone on Monday. On Tuesday, current S&P analysts   the AA+ rating he set almost a decade ago. This is a lightly edited transcript: : In 2011, markets whipsawed almost daily on the debt-ceiling talks. Then lawmakers struck a deal. Then came the S&P downgrade. What do you remember most about that period? : The congressional brinksmanship motivated the 2011 downgrade. You had a clear — although perhaps remote — possibility that the U.S. government would default on its debt, triggered by the debt ceiling. The Federal Reserve had in place plans to unilaterally extend debt maturities, which for S&P would have been a default. And it’s a very bad rating transition to go from AAA to D. The fiscal position was a contributing factor, but the main factor was the political setting and the congressional brinksmanship. : Proponents of MMT would argue that the U.S. can’t default on its debt because it’s the monopoly issuer of its own currency. Do you agree with that? : We have examples of local currency defaults, and the U.S. government defaulted on its bonds in 1933. It can happen. : Right, but that was abrogating the gold clauses. : Yes, they repudiated the gold clauses in public and private sector contracts. We have a fiat currency, but you can think of other local currency defaults. Obviously there’s 20 ratings between AAA and D, and if you’re rated AA+ or anything in the triple-A, double-A, single-A category, the chances of default are remote. But there’s a gradation between indigo and navy blue that these ratings try to pick up. : You and S&P were criticized for overestimating what the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio would be in 2021. Now here we are, and it’s even higher than you thought, and the government just passed another $1.9 trillion in fiscal aid. How would you describe the country’s current fiscal position? : One thing to remember is that the fiscal position of a government is just one element of its creditworthiness. The American Rescue Plan Act will weaken the country’s position, just the same way as the large corporate tax cuts of 2017 did. It will also probably do nothing to improve its trend growth rate because it’s not addressing public investment. But it may, however, strengthen the social contract. My view is this act is a political measure, and in the end it’s going to have to be evaluated in political terms. The social contract has weakened a great deal during my lifetime, and if the act comes to be seen as strengthening the social contract, it might be worth the cost. : What do you mean by the social contract? : According to Rousseau, you turn over a part of your liberty to be governed by central authority for reasons of security and for mutual benefit. And that has to apply to everybody in the country. And in the last 30 to 40 years, depending on how you count, 10% to 20% of the population has done very well and the other 80% has done less well, and people are beginning to resent that. You need a set of policies that brings everybody along. : OK, so the fiscal position is worse relative to 2011. What about the other factors that S&P considered in its sovereign ratings? If you were still in your old seat, would another downgrade be on the table? : You’d have to say the effectiveness of governance has improved lately. That would be on the plus side. But the fiscal position has deteriorated markedly. That’s on the negative side. And the rest is pretty much the same, the real economy, the monetary settings and the external position. Neither the Republican nor the Democratic parties have shown any ability to carry out countercyclical fiscal policy in good times. It’s one thing to have countercyclical fiscal policy in bad times, but you have to have some contraction when times are good. And we haven’t seen that. We didn’t see that in the four years running up to the election, and we’re not seeing it now. Now, you obviously don’t want to contract your fiscal position in the middle of a pandemic, but we already had a couple of measures that were fairly generous heading into this and will bear their fruit imminently, and now we’ve just enacted another front-loaded fiscal plan that’s going to add at least $1.9 trillion of debt. : So based on everything you’ve seen from sovereign nations around the world, what’s the endgame? : Eventually, there will have to be a fiscal correction. Or, if we don’t, in the extreme — default on the debt. Now, what’s likely to happen is there will be measures of financial repression and policy makers will slowly try to inflate the debt away. That would be one endgame, and that worked fairly well in the 50s and 60s, so maybe it’ll work again. It’s not your optimal solution. I think eventually taxes will have to rise, they’ll have to rise not only to adjust for what we’ve been doing the last few years but they’ll have to rise for increased health expenditures. Those will have to be fairly broad-based because you simply can’t get sufficient funds for what we’re talking about out of the superrich. And that can be done. But it takes a national consensus, it takes bipartisanship and it takes people taking a long-term view. : Given what we know now, do you have any regrets about the downgrade? : I think we’ve been validated — events have validated us. And again, although I don’t think the chance of a default because of a debt ceiling is that high as long as the Democrats control both Congress and the White House, that won’t always been the case. That could reemerge.

Americans Have $1.7 Trillion to Burn in Revenge-Spending Binge," Shoppers are out for vengeance. A year into a pandemic that’s devastated lives, jobs and the economy, those who are lucky enough to have disposable income are ready to go out and splurge — even if they still have nowhere to go in that stunning dress or those brand new sneakers. Some are calling this “revenge spending.” U.S.  retail sales  are near record highs and employment and vaccinations are on the rise. Americans have amassed a massive stockpile of excess savings — Bloomberg Economics estimates it to be about $1.7 trillion since the beginning of the pandemic through January. And that’s about to be bolstered by a new round of stimulus payments. As the economy reopens, consumer spending over the next two quarters is likely to be the strongest such period in at least 70 years with a rebound in services leading the way, according to economists at Wells Fargo & Co. “A lot of the snapback in spending will come from those more leisure expenditures — your discretionary expenditures,” said  Shannon Seery , an economist at Wells Fargo. Those are the areas that “we really expect to bounce back once the economy returns to some semblance of normal."" Revenge spending was seen as early as last April in China after the government began easing back to normalcy after the nation was the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in its early days. The impact on companies was clear: U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co.’s China sales surged 90% in May from the year prior, while Hermes, the French luxury label known for its $10,000 handbags, raked in $2.7 million in one day from a store reopening in Guangzhou. China has been recovering ever since, even as the virus continues to rage across Europe and North America. The reopening of the nation’s domestic travel corridors sparked a tourism revival, with locals visiting destinations like Macau and Hainan. They’ve been spending so much there that brands like Ralph Lauren Corp., Estee Lauder Cos. and Coach are all scrambling to  . There’s universal hope that there’ll be a similar fervor in the U.S. too. While the U.S. economy will likely reopen gradually over the course of 2021, the federal government is already starting to distribute stimulus checks.  suggests one-time payments boost spending more than steady payments that lead to a higher income. “This round of stimulus is coming at the same time that the economy is properly reopening,"" said  Michelle Meyer , head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Corp. “If you have a lot in your bank account already, you don't have very much debt to pay off, you probably do feel more comfortable spending the stimulus check.” Even the previous round of $600 stimulus checks, which were less than half the size of the incoming $1,400 payments, helped drive a January spike in discretionary purchases. U.S. retail sales jumped by the most in seven months amid increased spending on clothes, electronics, home furnishings and more. Department stores saw a nearly 21% increase in sales from the prior month.  And there’s room to grow, since sales at many types of stores and restaurants remain below their pre-pandemic levels. While   from January’s breakneck pace — in large part due to severe winter weather — the new round of direct checks will give fresh support to consumers. The $1,400 payments could give restaurant sales a lift for up to seven weeks, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence.  It may take slightly longer for the wealthiest to shell out cash like they once did. The top 10% of earners account for nearly half of personal outlays in the U.S., according to calculations by Wells Fargo. These consumers, who have been forced into saving because of social distancing, are likely to come out in full force as the health crisis subsides and herd immunity is reached, Meyer said. Almost half of U.S. consumers, meanwhile, said they’d buy little luxuries in the next six months. Over a third said they’d go in on even bigger, more expensive products, according to a survey from Accenture.  U.S. retailers from discount clothing stores to luxury jewelry boutiques have been waiting for this for months. Signet Jewelers Ltd., owner of Jared and Kay Jewelers, had hoped it’d come in time to bolster Valentine’s Day sales in February. That didn’t work out, but it’s better late than never.  The CEOs of Abercrombie & Fitch Co., Coty Inc. and TJX Cos., which operates TJ Maxx, have each mentioned the prospect of revenge shopping boosting business in the coming months. Poshmark Inc., an online resale marketplace, said sales of summer dresses doubled in February from a year earlier. CEO Manish Chandra said it’s an early sign that the population is ready to get out and spend.  “That to me tells us that we are getting ready for something,” said Chandra. “I think we’re all ready for that. America’s definitely ready and the world seems to be ready as well.” Rileigh Christenson, a 23-year-old in Elk Rapids, Michigan, who works in marketing, said she’s extremely ready. She’s committed to taking a dream vacation with her boyfriend after waiting to do something — anything — for the past year. They started putting aside money until they had a few thousand dollars to blow once the virus recedes. “I randomly saw someone on TikTok who was in Alaska and I was like, ‘You know what? I’m pulling the trigger,’” Christenson said. “It’s happening as soon as it’s safe.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/retailers-prepare-for-wave-of-shoppers-as-covid-vaccines-rollout,"[{'id': 'Europe', 'type': 'Region', 'derivedScore': 0.7092634909474425,

South Africa Sticks to Budget Stance Amid Student Protests," South Africa is committed to consolidating debt and fostering economic growth even as it faces pressure to increase funding for universities and raise civil servants’ wages, Deputy Finance Minister  David Masondo  said. “Everything is going to be funded within the current fiscal framework,” he said in an interview on Tuesday. “Unavoidable funding pressures will be financed through expenditure reprioritization.” Masondo’s comments underscore a   that became evident in last month’s annual budget. It backtracked on plans to raise personal taxes and switched focus to boosting consumption and private investment to shore up an economy that contracted the most in a   in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Funding for higher-education institutions was cut by 8 billion rand ($535 million) over the next three years in the budget, as the Treasury signaled its intention to narrow the fiscal deficit and contain debt by reducing expenditure. The cabinet pledged to make   available to the National Student Financial Aid  last week after students staged protests in several towns to demand free education and the write-off of their outstanding fees. While the finance and higher education ministers are working out how to access additional money, the budgetary framework won’t be compromised, Masondo said. The deputy minister also held the line on the government’s plan to freeze salaries for state workers for the next three years. The wage bill has ballooned over the past decade, has been a major contributor to the dire state of government finances and hindered the hiring of more teachers and nurses to service a growing population. Negotiations for a new pay deal with labor unions that represent 1.3 million state workers are currently under way. The government reneged on a deal to grant pay increases agreed for the final year of a previous three-year pay deal, arguing that they were unaffordable, a decision the unions are contesting in court. The government decided against increasing taxes to help fund additional expenditure because of the adverse effect on consumers’ disposable income, according to Masondo. The money could instead be channeled into spending or investments, which would in turn help widen the tax base, he said. The deputy minister reiterated the government’s commitment to structural economic reforms and said it’s considering selling some of the more than 700 companies it owns, without identifying them. Repeated bailouts for loss-making state-owned companies including power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. and South African Airways have been a major drain on the state’s coffers.
